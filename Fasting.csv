1,"Actual fasting history is buried in a sub menu (under the Menu > ""Me"" > ""Timeline"") when it's the main thing I want. UI is messy with pictures of people and random links on top of the basic fasting tracker interface."
1,Do not pay for this app. It's terrible. When I signed up I must've missed the fine print after the you can cancel anytime! line that said I won't receive a refund. That's terrible. It's been a few days. I've never had an app that didn't give a refund.
1,"End fasting doesn't always work. annoying. I press end fast and confirm Yes. When I come back after eating window, the app is still in fasting and asks me if I want to end fast. Tracking fasting and eating are the only features I need This app is failing with those tasks."
1,"Has been fine for a while, but now you have to watch a 20 or 30 second ad every time you open the app. I'm typically only in there for a few seconds to update my timer. Not worth my time. Deleting and finding something else."
1,"I am being charged a subscription fee for this app. Not only have I not subscribed or consented to this subscription, I didn't even know there was/is a subscription option! And I don't see anywhere in the settings to cancel or even view the subscription."
1,"I'm fine with ads, but you ap developers need to regulate how ads function. Fullscreen ads with no way of getting out of them or making it extremely difficult to close leading to accidentally opening a website screams scam."
1,Too many ads that you can't skip (I mean minutes long) to even open the app. Looking for another app.
1,Be sure to cancel well in advance if you don't want to renew! I canceled my subscription a week prior to renewal and was still charged for another year!
1,Too many ads. Makes you sit through a 1 min ad every time you open the app. Ridiculous.
1,"BEWARE: The dev does not give notice if you are subscribed and charges you, you will only find out after looking at your bank. no email saying this is about to be charged. no invoices, no communication. It is impossible to get a refund. DO NOT paid TRIAL OR SUB, maybe don' t even download. Don't bother with subscription. I was hoping for meal plans but only a hand full of recipes(no planning day by day), the extra information is not worth a sub that and more can be found on YT."
1,"Don't mind some adds but this is rediculous, makes the app almost unusable and would not consider purchase if this is how they operate. Update: Uninstalled, a short add or 2 is fine, they run 30 second plus adds. Makes app unusable. Avoid this and try something else."
1,"Ads are too frequent and too long. The photo ads that appear each time you open the app are acceptable, but those video ads where you have to wait five seconds to close them are a true test of patience."
1,can't get in too many ads that won't go away and if I close the app and open again.... another ad pops up
1,"Re: in-ter-mit-tent, adj., occurring at irregular intervals; not continuous or steady."
1,Add pop out every time I open it and try to log. Waiting time to close the app is even longer than the time I log my data. I ended up spending lots of time waiting to close the ads every day. It's very time consuming and annoying.
1,Incredibly long to boot up and lots of long ads just to pull up fasting timer.
1,"Using it for 55 days ,off last week it started paidzing, I uninstalled and reinstalled it lost all data despite it syncing,shows no badges, no awards this is frustrating."
1,"If you want a simple way to track a fasting option, this one will nickel and dime you. Tracking 1 meal a day fasting is a paid option, which is absurd."
1,"Nah fam. With the newest update, I can't set my own eating period unless I go paid. Rather, you purposefully made it more cumbersome to do so as I would need to change it every day? 5 star to 1 star, just like that. I'm uninstalling and finding a better app."
1,"It's ok to have ads, it's not ok to have LONG ads. More than 30 sec ad just to click a button? What happened to this app...."
1,"WAY too long to open due to having to watch ads 1st....had it for a long time, switching to something else."
1,"Even though I bought no ads months ago, they have put ads in every part of this app. It's complete trash now and unusable."
1,I just paid for premium and still get ads and asking to sign up from premium. I am about to reverse some charges on a card.
1,It used to be good now its not informative and full of ads.
1,"The ads contains sexual content, I wrote multiple feedbacks no solution. Uninstalling"
1,Very poor service you guys keep on debiting from my card and that should stop I've cancelled my subscription but still yet debit from my card
1,"not user friendly, only want your money. Can't setup a lasting, custom fasting period. Deletes all your data after you are done. Terrible."
1,Y the hell so much ads these days.. I have used this app before a year.. and I'm trying to follow IF again.. I'm trying to check State for motivation.. stupid ads are there how many ever time I refresh.. need help or I'm uninstalling ur app
1,App doesn't always log starts or finished fasts. Gets annoying as it's now 90% of the time.
1,"The ads recently have gotten much longer when you open the paid app. I like the app, I don't mind watching an ad for the paid version, but the ads are approaching 30 seconds just for me to start the timer. I deleted it and will find another."
1,Too much advertising. Not usable.
1,"My data is all gone when I reinstalled the app in another phone,8 months data completely gone, so disappointing!!"
1,Is anyone having trouble setting the fasting beginning to the end? When i do it manually it never allows my plan accurate.
1,"They have the worst photo shopped before and after I have ever seen üòÇ and it'll say the guy lost 4 lbs and it looks like a 30 lb difference, I don't trust the 4.9 rating now I think they paid."
1,Very annoying ads every time you open the app that lasts for a while !!
1,"It was by far the best app for IF but now they show you an ad the moment you open the app. Of course if you don't pay the premium, you get adds but they used to be just adds, now they are annoying and stopping you from getting the info you want to check."
1,Used to love this practical app! And then... They gave into the advertising sirens with those lengthy Royal frigging Match ads. I usually use the app 30 sec at a time to keep track so having to watch almost a min of ad is counterproductive. Uninstalling
1,if you ever want to close your account it very difficult to close your account. In Google it will only allow you to pause the account. be aware
1,"Loved this, but now, 6 ads back to back, and I still can't get it open to log. C'mon It opened after 7 ads."
1,uninstalled. the ads became very annoying unlike before it was bearable and quick.
1,"Th y did not interact with me. But quietly took my money behind the scenes. I have no order. I downloaded the ""paid"" app"
1,Used to be very good before introducing overly invasive and unreasonably frequent advertisements.
1,"Everytime I jumped to a different screen, an ad popped up. This was irritating and difficult to negotiate thru the app. I understand that this is a way for revenue but I spent more time closing windows than on the app. Sheesh. Going back to Fastic."
1,"So far so good. I like the app, not so crazy about the ads. **UPDATE- Had to delete app, I can't sit through a 30 sec ad to just log in, that's bananas. Who wants to watch an ad before they can even get onto app to log info ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,Pretty basic app unless you want to pay $$$ and of course theres ads which are annoying. We always love having a skip the dish ad pop up in the last couple of hours of fasting. Not.
1,"Nice app in terms of the information it provides however, the paid version is full of unskippable ads every time you switch screens. Had to uninstall as I'm not interested in paying for a subscription service to remove the ads. Wish they offered a regular purchase option."
1,"This app is completely unusable if you don't pay. The advertising is extremely intrusive, you can't close out of it, the ads cover the whole screen and won't let you close you of them for a good bit. It's much too annoying, I'm giving up after a day."
1,I tried turning on the notification and the phone non stop vibrating. Overall the app is easy to use! I tried to uninstall and install back the app. All my data lost! My trackings for a month lost! I paid the premium and i have to start over again
1,Not usable on Pixel 6. It is not possible to skip or close any of the ads. Even when they've played the close button does not work. I have to close the whole app and reopen it every time an ad is played.
1,This is really freaking hard to figure out how to work. I'm constantly just going around poking things stop how to stop the feeding program. I can't even change the times if it's minutes plus or minus without it starting the whole what do you want your program to be again.
1,"Takes very long to open, not usable if you just want to track your fasting. For setup, I gave my last and first meal and they gave me exactly the time between the two for fasting. Most buttons which promise info just lead to the pay version. Useless app..."
1,"I uninstalled this because of the new ""full page"" style of ads, just like the word and picture game apps, not because of the fasting content. Now the app still shows up on my update list. Hopefully it will go away. I do not appreciate having to complain."
1,"I am a paying customer, it is not worth the price. That being said, a paid use would not have any issues with the app. I tried custom plans, twice, and each time my progress was removed at the end of the week, I contacted support but no response. Get another app."
1,I have recently done a paidbsubscription to Fasting Tracker app. It's been a while since I am trying to get in touch with the team. Have sent several feedback through emails but no one seem to bother. I need to cancel my subscription Can someone please revert asap
1,"30 unskippable ads... This app was always my go-to fasting tracker but now I realized I need to find a new one. Half of the features are premium only, and now we get inconvenient 30 second unskippable ads on top of that! Way to go üëèüëè"
1,Trying to get in touch with someone several times but it doesn't work I get a fail message. I am struggling with the fasting timing can't change the clock to the time i started. And i paid for premium for the menus but they are not bad fot me.
1,TERRIBLE!! Worked terrible until I did a factory reset on my phone and now there is NO WAY to login into my premium account. I've also lost all of my data from my previous fasts. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could. The developers need to fix this!
1,"Ads are out of control. Everything you do, you're forced to view an ad and with countdowns to be able to skip them, no less. Ads about ""better sex"" now just earned an uninstall. There are lots of apps that do the same job but are not so obnoxious with their ads."
1,"Lost all data when my phone had to be reset. I didn't realize I had to sync after I purchased the 1 yr subscription. Very disappointing, glad I took snapshots here and there. 6 mos of hard work lost."
1,Don't try to close and update app to get features you're missing in the premium services. All data disappeared and can't seem to recover it. Waste of money at this point and first impression of the app after buying premium service for literally no gain.
1,"It kept resetting what I put in and not saving data. Also had to watch ad videos multiple times every time I opened the app or did anything on it, so annoying. Deleted almost immediately."
1,"Don't pay for this app. I thought I'd have more flexibility when I subscribed, but honestly, it's harder to adjust and less flexible than the paid version. The notifications don't work. There honestly doesn't seem to be a point to this app at all. Waste of money."
1,"I like the app a lot. I understand why there are ads with the paid version and normally that's fine with me. Hoever, when the ads run and I can't close the app or switch apps during said ad we have a problem. #uninstall"
1,Easy to use Explains benefits at exact times Gives you an easy time frame So far Love this app. Once u subscribe this app does not work at all! Only way to change anything is to delete previous info which defeats the purpose of the app. Very annoying
1,"I had a terrible review. Then they snuck in annoying ads and hopped on the subscription bandwagon. Let me make a one-time payment to get rid of the ads. If I can't do that, then you won't get my ad revenue either. I recommend everyone else do the same."
1,"This used to be a terrible app with some occasional and tolerable ads, which is fine, they need to make $$ - I get that. Lately though the ads are like these 2 minute long Gardenscapes ads that last longer than it takes me to use the app. Incredibly annoying"
1,"The app is nice, however i have an issue as i have paid for a 1year subscription and still getting adverts. This is really annoying and i feel cheated. Can this be sorted please or I get my full refund as i dont see the point of subscription. thanks"
1,Ads are a pain. I really liked this app. Then it started pushing this yahtzee ad. It wont go away till u play. Then it runs a minute ad. I gave in and tried to play to make it go away. It kept making me go to the play store to download. Super annoying.
1,"Very frustrating. I clicked on the button to end fasting but when I finish my eating period it then asks me do I want to end fast, meaning it hasn't recorded my eating period. I then had to manually input the time. Happens every day!!"
1,Poor Support. I purchased the Premuim version but cannot access the features. I ask for help but keep getting the same reply. I have stopped and restarted the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but all nothing. So I have for something that does not work.
1,"I am unable to change end times of fasting. Then the incessant beeping I couldn't stop. I paid for 6 months, but had to uninstall & reinstall. Then I no longer had the paid plan. It's a rip-off."
1,I purchased an annual subscription (it was on-sale) that lasted maybe 2 months. I'm owed another 10 months. There also is no customer support in the app. A feedback option isn't at all the same thing. The app itself is fine for what it is.
1,Tried this out and immediately uninstalled the app. So many ads popping up. Everytime I open the app it has a pop-up to purchase the paid content and many things were just locked behind a pay wall.
1,Why can't the sound be turned off for ads?! I've looked in settings and can't figure it out. Never had an app like this just open with sound blasting and no option to mute. Definitely not using this anymore if that's the case...
1,Poorly explained or non-existent instructions. Functionality inadequate. Pointless app. It's easier just to set alarns on your phone to remind you when to start/stop fasting.
1,It's a player of unclosable advertisements. Very frustrating when you have to force close an app due to persistent ads. The X button does not function and is for decoration only.
1,I paid for a monthly subscription and was bumped off of it after 2 weeks. The app goes back into suggesting I go premium. Google still shows that I am still subscribed. Not sure if this is an error or if this is robbery.
1,Update. It's still awful! The time edit feature is so clumsy to use and the design doesn't allow simple typed input of the time. I'm now looking for a better fasting tracker. Plenty around.
1,"Too much adds :( close button do nothing, I press it but nothing happens, so I need to close app and reopen it to be able to use. App is basically just a timer but the splash screen loading time is insainly slow."
1,"Purchase is too much money. paid version was ok at first, then ads start popping up and have to wait for ad to finsh before using app. Deleted. Using stopwatch built into smartphone. Works as well."
2,"it's glitchy after recent update. When you end your fast, you cannot adjust the time back if tou need to. It does not give you a ""today"" selection, which ruins your data and your stats. This didn't used to happen. I hope it's fixed soon or I'll have to find a different tracker app."
2,"The app looks good and works well, but the ads are too numerous and too intrusive. Especially the video ones when you open the app. They aren't skipable, and they seem to cause a delay opening the app (maybe while they load)?"
2,"The ads are way too intrusive. I don't mind ads, that's how you get paid I get it, but when I'm in a hurry and trying to open the app and an ad plays right off the bat, I'm finding another solution"
2,"So obnoxious. I just needed a simple fasting tracker (I've been intermittent fasting for years). Instead, I got a busy UI, too many popups, and annoying questionnaire filled with obnoxious messages I don't need. Two stars for not selling my data."
2,A lot of the options are locked behind a paywall. OMAD is also locked behind a Paywall. They give the option for custom but you can only set a start and have to manually stop the fast. I will be look at other options.
2,"It's a decent app if you pay for the subscription. Feels like it's made for kids, though, as every day you finish you get a million ""badges"". I just wanted a simple fasting timer."
2,"Money hungry app. Way too many ads, and takes forever to open. Note for the owners, do you really need to have ads when you have so many subscribers. Make the UI experience the best and see what will happen."
2,Way too many adds. It's a nice app but if I have to wait 40 seconds and watch an add to see where I'm at in my fast - not worth it.
2,"There are way too many ads. You can't even get into the app without having to watch a whole ad. If you somehow ignore the ads, though, it's a fair app, easy to use and understand, and the fasting achievements makes it more fun."
2,It was a terrible app up until a few days ago. Now it's nothing but a bunch of pop up advertisements. Will be deleting this app after I finish my fast. Disappointed
2,"terrible App, but enough with all the ads! After Every action is an Ad, just plain greed. Very frustrating."
2,terrible app but I'm trying to cancel my subscription and I'm still getting charged!! I can't find end subscription option in settings please help
2,"I had to delete the app. After a year or so, I had to endure far too many ads just to track my progress. By the time it loaded, I forgot what I was attempting to do! The problem worse as time went on. Now, I'm searching for a new app."
2,This don't give me any update or notifications when to start or stop eating when I close the app. Therefore it's not really useful
2,"Used to be good until now. I have to endure a full minute of advertisement to open the app. Now it is uninstalled, thank you very much."
2,"Ads are excessive, and things it advertises, like the body status are no where to be found."
2,"Had to remove a few stars. Can't get past the ad to get into the fasting app. It's in another language. I have everything set to English, not sure what's going on. Since I can't use the app, it goes from 5 stars down to 2."
2,I paid for the premium but found it difficult to keep track. Once you have a plan in place you can't flex it day to day easily so I ended up ignoring it and not keeping data. Ended up going back to the paid Fastic app where I could just push a button to start and end fasts.
2,You have to constantly reset customized plans. It's a hassle and really not worth the price.
2,It's a very basic app. I can't edit the end fast time until the day has passed and that's really annoying. My schedule moves around and I don't have an exact set time to eat. There needs to be more ability to. personally control the times on a day by day basis.
2,"Busy UI, had to hunt for the buttons. very clearly in the paid band (constant reminders), prices for the paid version are super steep. I found a more straightforward app that does the same thing for paid (or a reasonable fee to get rid of the ads)"
2,"I've used this app for years and love it, but recently, ads have been implemented, and despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app, the ads won't close. The ""x"" button doesn't work, and every time you open the app, an ad comes up. I can't even use it anymore."
2,terrible to start with. It doesn't remember every time I enter for fasting though. I have to keep screen shots of my start and stop times so I can reenter them the next day or week. It can be very frustrating!
2,"The UI is well laid out and slick. However, i think the app does just too little to justify paid subscription. There are just a few recipies included. Basically it just tracks the times when you start/stop eating. Does not track food/nutrient intake."
2,Installed app and loved it but recently it started to lock up on countdown for feeding and fasting windows. Also gave me awards for fasting for 100 weeks but I have only been using the app for over 2 weeks. I have just reinstalled the app and may update my review.
2,App is terrible but I synced my data when I switched phones and none of my badges or accomplishments transferred over. I've tried contacting the app through 4 emails now with no response. They need to figure out a system where at least someone will reply to you.
2,"I've already changed my subscription to premium for 1 month to try it out, yet there's no any change in the feature of fasting plans. I was hoping to be able to access the autophagy plans instead of the old ""custom"" feature."
2,It kept losing my fasting times that I entered. I would have to restart and what a pain that was. Really difficult to use. The timer scroll was so sensitive that it would shut if I went past the end even a slight fraction. Gave up and downloaded a different one.
2,"If I turn alert on it is constantly going off. I would really like to see my progress as I like the icon on top when in use. On custom it does not give me an end time to choose, so not very versatile. Some of the info is good."
2,"Nice idea, but doesn't function properly. Won't retain my daily data. Won't allow me to edit previous data. Doesn't seem to sync with actual date/calendar. Options for setting/editing start and end times doesn't associate yesterday/today timeline correctly."
2,"Brilliant UI. But honestly the ads are killing it. The app doesn't push through notifications so i would have to manually open it, what's more annoying is everytime i open and close it i have to watch the ads. Nice try forcing me to pay the subscription."
2,The ads made me delete. I think it's a good app but the ads have become too aggressive. I can't stand apps that show me an ad when I first open that app. There are plenty of other fasting apps that don't have such aggressive ads.
2,"Notifications don't happen, it seems pointless to have the option for an hour's notice if nothing happens - same on my partners phone. Apart from that the app's decent, but it's a pretty major component that doesn't work so I need to look elsewhere."
2,The UI is very confusing. I couldn't find how to create your own fasting plan. For example 17 - 7. Also the default notification settings are just annoying: way to many notifications that I don't care about.
2,"I like the app, but the biggest issue I have with it is that it seems to glitch and stops app notifications after a while. So it's very easy to forget to start or stop your fast, and completely forget about the app altogether, which is why I would never buy the premium version."
2,"Graphics are abismal to look at and the notification looks horrible, being just awkwardly shoved into your notification bar. Just stick with the usual notification, don't try to look so different. Other than that, it's fine. Tracks time and stuff. Idk"
2,"I like the functionality of this app however I paid for the premium version for a year, and I only received premium for about a month before it went back to ads. I don't seem to be able to reach anybody at the company to fix this issue!!"
2,Way too mnay ads that make it not worth wasting my time. Start with next to no ads but after using for a while they show full screen ads that you have to wait for after every action you take in the app. It just a glorified timer. Sorry but this app is too infuriating to use now.
2,"Liked the app, but the notifications didn't work on my phone. I didn't want the notification banner on, but I wanted the pop up notifications to let me know when fasting started and stopped, and they never happened. Bummed because I liked the rest of the app."
2,Would be a fantastic app if you could properly modify your dates and times. If you go to end a fast later than scheduled and press modify it allowed you to choose yesterday as the date but today doesn't show up. Very frustrating as it makes my fasts inaccurate.
2,"Too many ads-ads lock up screen. Ads continually pop up to the point that screen is disabled. UPDATE: Thanks for your reply. I have enjoyed the App otherwise, and will definitely give it another chance."
2,It looks like it would be a good if I actually got the features I paid for. I subscribed to the monthly plan to try it out and it hasn't unlocked any of the extras that it's says it's suppose to. Pretty disappointing.
2,"I'm only giving 2 stars because I'm not able to upgrade to the 6 month plan within the app. I press ""continue"" and nothing happens. I've sent two emails to try and get help with this with no reply I like everything else about the app :)"
2,"worked terrible the first week, now it shows ""feeding window"" in my notification window when I'm in the middle of a fast. can't get rid of the wrong notification without disabling the notifications all together."
2,"I enjoyed using this app and keeping track of my fasts. After weeks of use, it would not open so I had to uninstall and reinstall it and it ended up losing all my progress and past data. So disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è"
2,"It might be a good app if you buy premium. I wanted to test it out before I actually spent money on it, but there are so many ads I can't navigate the app. What I did manage to explore didn't do much besides try to upsell premium. Personally, this is useless."
2,"I have made the payment for annual subscription. The amount was debited from my credit card on yesterday. But still the subscription is not active on my app. Please resolve the issue or give any email id of yours, so that i can contact you further."
2,"So disappointed. I have been using this app for 168 days. I had to change my phone over, and in spite of everything being synced to Google fit, my data will not transfer. So on my new phone I am back to square 1 ."
2,I liked the information that the app provided. Im new to fasting and reality liked the clock and such. However I have to rechoose my fasting option about every 4 days and reset everything and that's frustrating. It had said feeding window for 3 straight days.
2,Very focused on weight loss. Does not allow for longer fasts that target longevity/autophagy. The learn section of this app also seems very light compared to others.
2,This app crashes my phone. my phone runs too slow and Google maps crashes while giving me navigation. very unfortunate waste of money because I really liked using the app and I'm loving all the information. Had to uninstall !
2,"Tired of it forgetting. I'm very OCD about entering info in apps like this and randomly, it will forget and tell me that I've been fasting for 2 days. The notification icon randomly disappears too. Potentially a good app, but I give up."
2,"This used to be my go-to app for tracking my fasts, but it's gotten so clunky and in - your-face about upgrading to a pro version that I don't even want to use it any more. The entire app is just one giant ad for their paid service."
2,"This app doesn't do more than what I can do with notifications/event scheduler in my phone and a Google search for intermittent fasting schedules. Nice, but honestly I don't see what value it delivers."
2,"That app is terrible in the beginning. I paid for premium,although there are no changes with the app. It's the same as if I did not pay for premium. Going to cancel it since it's no different than just using the basic app."
2,Good app once it was working properly. Randomly one day I stopped getting notifications in when my eating period had ended. I've deleted and redoenloaded the app 5 times now and it still doesn't. All the settings allow notifications. Its very annoying
2,"I would love this app more if they allowed you to put an end fast time in for the custom section. You can put a start time but no end time, you only just hit end fast. Frustrating, it's nice to have a count down."
2,This app misrepresented what it does. It made it seem like if you got premium you would have a custom fasting plan but it just directs you to some generic ones. Very misleading and not worth paying for.
2,"After using it for over a month, the app is clunky and I continue to have to reinitiate the program I'm using. I'm assuming this has to do with me not purchasing the service, but the lack of consistency doesn't endear me to buy a subscription."
2,"AND now the weight input is not working. No matter how many times I put it in, the weight won't update. Annoying as it is linked to other apps and my weight won't update for any of it as of two days ago."
2,"Overall, this app is so corny. You could barely do anything in there without an ad popping up. They have possible cool features but, you'll never know unless you pay. The only good thing that i recall is the water reminder. Other than that, not interested."
2,"Uninstalling. It's ok at what it does, but the ads are getting too long and ridiculously disruptive. Also, would like to see better weight tracking visuals. Not sure why such a high rating."
2,"The app is terrible but there are a few glitches. My weight won't update. Also, I have a new phone and all of my fasts and info doesn't transfer over, so I'm basically starting over from scratch."
2,"The full screen in app ads just killed it for me, I'd buy the app but the only option is a subscription. There are plenty of fasting apps that can achieve the same objective without the hassle."
2,"It's almost good, but the tracking isn't good enough, notifications aren't loud so they can go completely unoticed, so forgetting to change from fasting to eating period is happening requently, need loud , alarm like notifications"
2,Not clear cut enough. Using bobyfast app much better direction and user-friendly with no ads even for the paid version!. Monthly it's a little more expensive the this app. But to me it's more worthwhile
2,Too cumbersome and limited for what it's intended to do (paid version). Ended up uninstalling and using my stock alarm clock app to set a series of alarms to match exactly what I wanted to accomplish.
2,"bad app, i download 5 different apps to compare. This one, one of the best, but ads often covering whohe screen, very frustrating. This wrong way to advertise. I will not use nor buy this app because full screen ads."
2,"Not bad for clean fasting: encourages use of dirty fast elements. Lots of ads, lots of locked premium content: understandable for devs, but makes this an app you should either fully buy into or not bother with."
2,"not bad for a paid app! update: december 25,2023 too much ads, like i closed the app midway the ads, relaunched 2x, and it would still play long ads. sorry, i think you guys were terrible at first.. if only positive feedback could pay the bills, huh? AGAIN, TOO MANY ADS"
2,Two stars because it's easy to use. But don't pay for the subscription. It advertised access to all plans but did not get access to all plans. Nothing changed except for no ads.
2,Can you log steps manually with this app? Seems used to be able?
2,"I did love this app, but now there's ads unless you pay for the premium. So Uninstalling and moving to a different one. Love this app. Everything is easy to enter and love the information for each phase of fasting."
2,"I tried out this application to possibly replace another one I had been using for a while but will go back to my old one. Too many ads, especially in a foreign language, and it takes a long time to open. This application looks nice but the ads aren't worth it."
2,"Too many ads, they pop up when you're trying to enter information and you can't dismiss them immediately. There are other paid fast tracking apps that work very well and not bloated with aggressive ads."
2,"It started off on a terrible start. One week in it started to track only fasting period, as soon as it was eating time the clock went right back to tracking fasting period. So now looking for a new app."
2,"Lots of annoying ads. Can not evaluate what it does, so distracting. bad idea though, with few changes can be a terrible tool."
2,"Not comparable to FASTIC, which is way better and at a lower cost."
2,It looked like it was going to be terrible but it's not or I really don't understand it. I set up my 16/8. The 16 ended and then it's like it reset. I hoped it would give me a notice that the fast was beginning but nothing.
2,A bit confusing on how to get it to work/edit through consecutive days. I thought i had edited it correctly but when i checked back it showed i had fasted 22hrs which wasnt accurate. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling.
2,A scheduling app does not need a recurring subscription charge. They try way too hard to sell a subscription.
2,"The ads are frustrating and annoying so much that many times I don't register my day in the app because I don't like to be bothered. I tried the premium for a while, but 4 euros per month it's not worth it."
2,I'm really not getting much out of this app. I paid for the ad paid version and really wish I hadn't now. It has one meal plan that I'll never look at especially as I'm vegetarian and there is no option to say I am. I might as well just track my fasting myself for paid.
2,"Originally gave this app 5 stars. Started having issues after about 20 days. Couldn't put in time after the fact. If you started a fast but missed input of time, you can't go back and put in the time."
2,The app is pretty bad. Main problem is the ads. Most ads can be skipped which is fine but sometimes they can't be which is very annoying.
2,Looks bad... But it's a trap because unless you buy I paid subscription the app is deliberately frustrating in it's lack of customisation. It's a trap. Don't use (unless your fine with subscription).
2,"Nice app but very very aggressive ads policy ! Just removed it and starting using some other more user friendly app with same functionality. It's OK to have ads in paid mode apps, but this WAY above normal ads rate."
2,"Ads are in the app are highly user unfriendly. They are ads that make sense, but the ads are blocking users for 30 sec to navigate away, locking the screen"
2,This could be the best application on fasting plus health and fitness issues but the only thing that keeps them down it only considers women. You may specify your gender as a man but they keep sending you tips and infos to helps women and not you (the man).
2,"This app would randomly not save my fasting start or end times. I'd hit save, close out the app, and have to go back in and re save. This happened 3-4 times a week"
2,"Having problems with tryimg to edit times of fasting. And how am i supposed to get to the higher ""levels"" on the changes going on from fasting if it wont let me go on continuous days."
2,Impossible to tweak start and end times to reflect actual. No instructions. Disappointed in lack of options when i upgraded to premium.
2,I loved the paid app and paid for premium to unlock the weekly plans but I can't find that option anywhere. When I start a fast it gives me the same 4 fasting options as when it was paid.
2,"Seems simple enough, but not even being able to save your most basic weekly fast schedule with out getting premium. Total BS. Will be checking other apps"
2,"It kinda works but too many commercials that continue playing sound even if you close them, I cant edit fasting end time and it's just not clear and intuitive."
2,Suddenly there are lots of ads without possibility to close [x] every time you want to update your weight or check something. In the beginning there wasnt as much ads.
2,"It was bad for a while, but they started adding 30 second ads when you start it up. It's a bit much for what is essentially a glorified stopwatch app."
2,"I upgraded to premium in order to gain access to the additional weekly plans like the '5-2' and the 'break for a day' options, but all it did was remove ads. I am disappointed!"
2,"I can put a timer on my clock app, would be as bad as this app. The topics and answers you can find with a simple YouTube or Google search are somehow premium features and require payment. Do you think I've been living under a rock or something?"
2,"Too many ads. Go from one menu to another there's an ad. Minimize app, go back and that's another ad. Had it show an ad while editing time"
2,I can't mark the actual start of my current fast because it's been longer than 2 days since I began. I do 5-day fasts. I am currently on 97 hours of my current 120-hour fast. This app is basically useless if I can't adjust the start and end accordingly.
2,Having the same issue some others are. I can't edit my end time to a time within the same day. I usually remember like 30m later after I finished eating... Not the next day! Wish they would fix this.
2,The app is ok but the whole reason I downloaded it was to track my fasting with reminders and the reminders to start and stop fasting never work so I always forget to keep track of my fasting so the app is pretty much useless to me.
2,Won't let you pick how long your fast is unless you pay. It gives 2 options and neither are the 20-4. Disappointing as the app seemed very streamlined.
4,"Just started using it. Trying the free version. So far app is easy to use. Not glitchy. Only hang up is the notification alerts have no sound. Just has a notification bar displayed, so when the timer is up, there's no sound alert. My volume is turned up in settings."
4,The app works really well and is helpful keeping track of fasting windows. Right now it only shows daily fasting charts. It would be nice if it would roll up trends weekly and monthly (eg graph of number of fasting hours per week and per month) so you can see overall trends.
4,"So far, so good. Will update later. One thing that would be REALLY helpful, is of the little notification icon changed color to res during the fasting window so that you could just tell at a glance if you are fasting or not."
4,I have been using it for just over a week. I use the free version and it works well for what I need it for. Tracking fasting hours and weight. One like 30 sec ad when I open sometimes otherwise no ads so far.
4,"So far I really like it! I got the premium. Helps me remember when I'm fasting and keeps track of progression. Let's me know when I hit new goals! However, I cannot find what to do when you need to skip a day or maybe several holiday/vacation days. Otherwise it's great!"
4,I've been using the free version for about a week. So far I'm enjoying it. Seeing the different levels during the fast motivates me to fast a bit longer each time
4,"Generally the App is very good and helpful, however I would love if there could be more features added to it. The feature of step counts would go along great next to the water daily intake feature."
4,"This app is very useful and informative. For someone new to intermittent fasting it has taught me so much. I would recommend this app to everyone, especially newbies like me and diabetics who insists on lifestyles changes. Thank you for this app."
4,Very clear. Easy to use. Would like to be able to do more than one challenge at a time.
4,"Is it intentional to have a full minute long video ad playing right when you open the app? Seems like a bit much. I generally like this app, have paid for premium in the past. But a full minute ad on every open will cause me to delete."
4,Coming from Zero and only one day on this app it is quite tough to judge just yet. The pay version is certainly better but about the same as the free version of Zero for a comparison. Love that it integrates with Google Fit which is why I switched.
4,"I'm just doing the basic free version and it keeps me on track with accountability. Can't ask for more than that, as it helps me form my own habits rather than pushing sole responsibility and necessary reliance on the app itself."
4,This app helps me stay on track for my eating periods. It also motivates me to eat less.
4,Think it's one of the best fasting apps it helped a lot while starting now I think it's time to let it go
4,Great app but a bit annoying due to adds. I wish there was a cheaper paid version for those who does need all features.
4,Really nice app it's like a diet manager it records your achievement so you can feel confident this is the best tracker and easy to use
4,Thank you for not forcing me to pay for stuff!! You're really helpful! I've been looking for wellness apps that can help me but not force me to pay a subscription.
4,i wish there was a way for the diet timer to start and stop manually cuz i always stop eating way earlier than the 4 hours and having to do it each time just keeps making me more conscious of eating in general
4,The app is good and easy to use but once you subscribe it is difficult to stop the auto subscription and I am still having challenges stopping it
4,"Great app, easy to use. Ads are fine."
4,"It's pretty straight forward and easy to use, if you are used to fasting it's easy to set on the free mode, but if you are new to fasting you need to pay for premium."
4,"This app is outstanding. They does charge you for anything to use the basics, and I find the premium privileges very easy to live without!"
4,In the water section whenever I enter my personal amount the app keeps changing it back even though I clicked saved to save my personal amount. Would appreciate it if you could fix that ASAP. Overall I've been using the app for 2 days and I feel the difference.
4,Been using for about a week and I've been enjoying it. There are some bugs besides the ads that flash and I've noticed at times it doesn't start my fasting session. So far so good plus I'm using the free version. I enjoy learning about the stages my body is going through.
4,Easy to use. Very informative. Only con it uses the battery a little too much
4,Great app for just plain and easy tracking
4,"Love this app except for how it more often than not doesn't save my time for when i record ""Time to fast ."" Maybe because there isn't a save button like when you break the fast? It's frustrating."
4,Tq for creater this software. though not premium but Verry nice and easy for me. Verry suitable for control sugar in blood and loser weight. For 1 month i lose 5 kg.
4,"Two ads per app launch, once for loading in and another after starting or ending fasting. 15+ seconds sometimes. Edit: I just paid for the permanent removal of ads. Not ideal, but it is what it is. Other than the ads, the app is fine, and does a good job."
4,Good tracker for what it's intended. Way to many ads though. One more TikTok ad isn't going to make me download the app. The tracker also gets confused on start and stop of fasting periods. I often have to put the data in three times as it just won't take the first time.
4,"love this app, but I am sure on my old phone I could customise the drinking trackers volumes!! I can't seem to do that now!!"
4,"It's a very nice app, the only problem is that we can't access many things when we does get premium."
4,"It is very helpful as a reminder to fast and drink water, it is helpful to know in what stage is my body depending on when I started fasting. The weight is not syncing with Google fit and also I would like it syncing with my fitbit."
4,Great app. Motivating bc it tells me when I'm in ketosis. Love the water reminders.
4,Mostly positive. I enjoy the way the app tracks when I can eat and what is going on with my body during my fast. I does like that I can't augment the app during the one day fast. For example I stopped eating by 7:30 pm but the app is keeping track from midnight.
4,"Very nice little app. Keeps you motivated. But it has no any data storage (cloud, data transfer etc). Recently I bought new phone (also Android) and couldn't transfer my data from the old one. All 3-month progress and achievements lost. So I'm giving it 4 stars."
4,"Easy to use, motivating and informative. The free version offers multiple fasting types, with even more options for a subscription fee. That is really the only downside. I'd gladly pay for a full version of the app, but subscribing is a bit much."
4,"This is decent. I like the interface. I does even mind the embedded ads. I am not however, a fan of the full screen interstitial ads, they suck. The UI is nice and clear, I like the notification tray and the overall user experience is good."
4,"Great app! I need a way to delete data points in the weight chart, please, I've lost 20 pounds of fat with intermittent water-fasting. I love this app.. it's a big help, and educational. I bought the ad-free option gladly."
4,"Nice app, visually clean and easy to navigate. Only improvement I would request is that there is a starting date for weight loss so that cumulative loss can be seen from the overview not just loss since last entry. Other than that- great."
4,"It COULD tweak a couple of things to make it more versatile and user friendly. And, It IS a bit over the top with the upgrade ads but? Considering the price of the upgrade? It's fairly cheap. So, I may try it and see how it is then. Otherwise? It seems like a pretty good app."
4,"Needs goal options, and to link with apps like Google fit and Mi Fit so you does have to log weight in multiple apps. I do love the permanent fasting notification it adds a good reminder to keep going as sometimes I forget I am meant to be fasting."
4,The app is quite simple and works as it should. However. It's a fasting app and one of its advisors is TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT FOOD. So I ask myself. Why is 99% of all the ads food related when your doing a fast? Are you being set up to fail?
4,"The app is great but the Ads are crazy..how does the app say ""During fasting keep your mind off food"" but the Ad is the Mr D food, showing a picture of food on it..please sort it out. I'm a beginner and the Ads are make it a challenge. Thanks"
4,A very good app with a lot of useful features for IF. Would get a 5 star if the Google Fit sync worked properly (does sync but has to be turned on and off every day for it to pull latest data)
4,"I really like this app, but I wish there were some widgets for fasting. So far, the free version is good for my fasting needs. I do like the averaged graphs for tracking weight. It would be nice to have more trends/graphs for fasting."
4,"great app and the water tracker is a huge help. my only complaint is that there isn't an option to skip a meal to extend the fast, and that the eating period isn't automatic and no way to track friends and keep it competitive."
4,So far so good! I'm really enjoying the seamless interface. It does a really good job of tracking my fasting periods as well keeping me educated and motivated to reach my goal.I really does mind going premium in the future. Lets see. more updates to follow :))
4,"Does exactly what I want it to. Tell me when to eat lol. Keeps track of weight lost (7 lbs in a week) and keeps me focused. It also has a ton of insightful progress goals along the way that I never had a clue about. Use friendly, good interface."
4,Free version is quite good enough. Premium gives a little extra. Easy to use and serve the purpose. A little problem is that I have set notification when fasting starts and ends but there is no notification show up on my S20+.
4,Really useful app. I like that it shows the different stages of fasting and the processes occurring in the body. I might be missing something but I would like the option to automatically repeat fasting each day instead of having to input it each day.
4,"This is a great app. I love that in addition to fasting, I can track water. The only imperfection is that it does not restart automatically if I restart my phone. In addition to the persistent notification (I love that), I would love to see a Widget."
4,"This app helped me to get into my intermittent fasting journey. Tracking my fasting and eating hours helps me to stay on track. As a shift worker with varying schedule, I cannot use a lot of the apps features, as they are designed for normal, regular schedules."
5,"Has been an exceptional fasting app so far! Easy interface to work with. Very simple! Love the water tracking, weight tracking, and body measurements tracking features. I love the fasting timer, which is always running in the background. This is what is keeping me on track!"
5,"this app is incredible! its very easy to navigate, it has nice graphics and pictures for the reminders, and its educational!! it was so nice to read what happens to my body in every stage, and it inspires me to reach my goals. i highly reccomend, especially for beginners!!"
5,"I've used this app before, and was paying for the subscription. Just reinstalled realizing it's not a temporary change it's a lifestyle change. This app is very motivating to want to beat your last achievement."
5,"Very informative and helpful, this app doesn't promote eating disorders and helps with health advantages. Gives very useful details about what happens to your body every few hours that you're fasting. I love this app."
5,Very nice app. I have the free version for now and it helps keep me on track. The only thing I wish is that it would automatically end the fast after the time the fasting ends. Instead we have to go in and hit end.
5,"I've been using this intermittent fasting app for a while now, and I gotta say, I'm impressed! It's super modern and user-friendly. Plus, it's packed with tons of useful info that's been a game-changer for my fasting routine. Highly recommend!"
5,"Very good app for intermittent fasting support and control. In free mode there are adds but not too annoying. Plenty of information, graphs and useful recommendations."
5,I does use most of the features in this app. It's easy to update the start and end times of the fast. The one thing I wish it had was a pause or vacation feature as I won't be fasting on vacation and I does really want the notifications.
5,Overall it's a good app. However I do wish there were alternative time lines for fasting. I does usually eat until 1 pm sometimes 2 p.m. so I wish there was a 1-9 fasting option. Good thing is I can manually change my fasting time! I like the app alot
5,"Love that you can personalise your fasting planner. Start and stop fasting, record weight and the rewards do boost you to keep going. I like this app a lot. When i can see it running in the background as im doing my normal day to day, it pushes me to stick at it."
5,"The app is basically the Best, it has kept me disciplined and motivated The Most important features are freely available I love that it shows the count down till end of the fast on the notification panel and shows which level u are at in terms of fat burning and explains it simply, I highly recommend üî•üëç‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"This app was working perfectly for a good 2 months. Then the ads popped up on my subscription. If you've had a business and personal email registered under Google for the past 10 years, the fasting app will not register your primary email to which you subscribed thus making it awkward and inconvenient to deregister your business email in order to make the app work ad free. The app refused to acknowledge their fault even after explaining that it worked perfectly for 2 months without ads."
5,"very simple to use. my only critique is that the ads open at the start, so sometimes when I want to end my fast, I have to wait for the ad to finish before I could stop the clock."
5,"Very simple and easy to use app. Also the ""always showing notification"" very helpful for quick info about today fast. I switched to premium after using it in a week. Please add more achievements badge and make it shareable to social media like instagram stickers or something similar. Adding exercise insight will be helpful too. Overall it's a great app."
5,It's a great app to fast with as long as you have the attention span to check your phone for reminders. I really enjoyed the teaching material that it provides on fasting.
5,My favorite thing about this app is that it tells you what is happening with your body based on the amount of hours you have fasted. Planning to get the paid version soon. I used it alongside 2 others for comparison and this is my favorite.
5,This has been a great app so far. It's very interesting going through the different stages of fasting and having an idea of what's going on with the updates from the app in time intervals.
5,"Nice and simple app, giving the fasting/eating time and reminder to drink water. I find it very useful and it helps me to keep with intermittent fasting"
5,I've used this App off and on for intermittent fasting. I've tried others but I keep coming back to this one. This time I went ahead and upgraded to the paid version to open more options. We'll see how that goes.
5,"This is the best fasting app , i,m currently 12 years old and i,ve been fasting for 48 hours ,and i can feel myself being more happy and i,m also able to concentrate better in class. And i like how the app has a water drinking tracker. But i have a question , how long will it take for me to lose about 15 pounds?"
5,Very user friendly and it's handy to keep tabs on your progress whenever you feel the need. Packed with useful tips to help you maximise your IF experience
5,I like the design of the app and it's features (very aesthetic). It's easy to use and understand (which is great for me). I also love that I can use the basic features of the app for free. <3
5,"Doing an amazing job! When I get my check will definitely upgrade to premium! This app does everything I need to track my progress and to keep me motivated to continue! I love the little milestone achievements it gives you as well, because it Is really nice to see some recognition for hard work. Absolutely appreciate this app and they have more than earned a lifetime customer with me. I would add if I could choose anything... a social area for fellow dieters to have further support. 10 stars!"
5,This is the most simple to understand no nonsense fasting app I've tried. I also really enjoy the hourly updates telling me what is happening in my body at different stages of the fast. That feels motivating to me.
5,"Good so far! Easy to use and lots of features- I'm seriously considering buying the year plan, which is pretty reasonable. Definitely recommend to anyone interested in fasting from beginners to experienced fasters. I think this app will be helpful to everyone."
5,"This is the most amazing app for intermittent fasting available, easy to use, complete progress charts , I loose 10.6 pounds so far with the guidance of this app, free to use without paying with a premium paid version that I'm considering to join, because this app is not just to loose weight but a healthy lifestyle . I tried all the others' apps until I found this one , highly recommended üëå the best so far and user-friendly. Thank you üòä üíì"
5,"So far so good! I've only been doing this for a week now, and it's been going pretty good. Better than counting calories or carbs. It's also easy to forgive. At this time I'm habit building. There's lots of good tips, challenges for those that need to be challenged, and a water intake monitor. I've been drinking loads more water which is healthier over all. Worth a try I think, especially if you hate counting."
5,"Well It's very comfortable guys you need to try it now and results would me as expected if you are committed to it and this app is easy to understand, features are really great and tips are wow"
5,"My only wishlist item would be a social feature. It's great flying solo, but sharing fasting adventures and tips with a community could be the missing spice. Overall, it's a solid app for anyone diving into intermittent fasting without making it feel like you're on a tech rollercoaster. Thumbs up from me!"
5,"Great app, I use it daily, paid for premium. Excellent for tracking fasted times. However the only thing I can ask for is a 'Body Fat Percentage' in the weight category, so that can be used as the tracker/goal. I does use KG for tracking my progress as that fluctuates too much, but body fat is more accurate"
1,"Gave up trying to line up the time. I could not for the life of me get the app synced up to my schedule. Then, the extra kicker is that every time I made an adjustment, I would need to watch an ad. I made 5 consecutive changes and watched an ad between each change. Truly obnoxious."
1,"Way too aggressive with the ads. And come on with the monthly charge for a mobile fasting app. Everyone is so greedy. Just charge a reasonable rate for app, you dont have to follow the trend of monthly plans."
1,"It does whatever it wants to do apparently. I eat between 4 pm-12am sometimes I eat later ,sometimes I eat earlier.last night I started fasting at 9pm but I just woke up at 4:53pm well the app decided to automatically start my eating period while I was asleep AGAIN. Which it's not supposed to do its supposed to overlap the time like it's always done.this is y I dont fw technology like that anymore bcz strange stuff happens."
1,An incredible amount of ads permiate the paid version of this app. A full page video ad shilling crypto now appears when I open or close any page in the app. Is 4.9 stars the time to start doing this? I wouldn't think so.
1,Why am I being charged again?? I paid $2.99 for the month. I wanted to switch type of fast so I ended week I was on early. Now app has locks on everything again. I just paid last week!! Help please
1,"This is not real fasting, this is about getting hungry. Real fasting it means to eat non greasy food just healthy like fruits and vegetables, drink a lot of water, eat raw food not cooked. For instance I am fasting every Friday, that means that day I eat only fruits and vegetables, no meat, noo milk products, no eggs, and it is enough to get control over what you choose to eat, and it raises your awareness over eating, as the feeling after fasting day is terrible you strive for healthier food after"
1,"I bought a yearly premium plan, and after 3 months, I start seeing ads and my account become non premium again. This is a scam!"
1,"Horrible,never download this app ever as soon as you get in the app it just closes,and as soon as I got in for the first time it was a nightmare,it was lagging so much,it was creepy,it said that someone was watching you,never download this app ever"
1,We all put up with adverts to try apps out but this one does not allow you to remove the advert after having read and acknowledged it.
1,"Cannot select 17:7, also bombarded with pop-ups to upgrade. No, thank you."
1,I dont think this is accurate because when u r fasting you cant drink water and this app says that water does not break your fast this absolutly wrong because when you are fasting you are not allowed to drink or eat.it is bad for normal days but its not bad for ramadan.
1,It's been terrible... I jxt can't lose wait on my own buh with dis fasting app... I feel bad cos it's lyk a companion Dat guides me with weight loss
1,I fell like this shouldn't be an app because of how easily someone can develop an ED from this. So I don't think the app should be rated for everyone.
1,Too many nonsense ads. Don't waste your time.
1,Way too many advertisement and lagged out and stopped tracking
1,"Couldn't restore premium account, after i switched from ios to android"
1,A lot is behind monthly pay wall.
1,You guys should have never made this it is not ok to tell people to fast my 23 year old daughter tried it and she ended up in hospital in the ICU center so any one who is doing this please don't this is life threatening if I could give this 0 stars oh don't sought me I would
1,Worst app ever ssly its so bad it tells me to leave one meal like ssly
1,I don't have money for get premium
1,I don't have money for get premium

1,Why? I can't restore my progress

1,stupid app
1,Bad
1,Worst
2,"App is ok. it's a little bit bloated with useless clatter. Also, there is no option for no weight loss. It forces you to pick up some goals, and there is no way around. The widget of this app is a complete waste of time, had no use, no sense, and it is bizarre. Shame. I wouldn't advice to pay for the premium version."
2,"Paid for the premium version. Still got ads. Bought the premium version for the autophagy fasts but there's only a 36 and 48 hrs plus you have to wait for 55 hr eating window before it will start. Theres no way to start an autophagy fast immediately. The custom plan feature doesn't work. I read in another post that the ""custom plan"" feature will be coming later. Why have the feature? This is just a pretty timer that has a few notifications that has very little customization. Dont bother"
2,Terrible UX. Ending fasting and starting a plan again gets frustrating if you use the paid version. Ads are huge and in your face and pop up between selections. Kinda suspect this is the highest rated fasting app...
2,"Just some (paid on google) interesting advice. The tracker is Useless junk. don't waste your money. NOTE..The developer responded with a suggestion that after spending $20., I should spend more on the Premium product ..... FAT chance....."
2,I don't see anywhere that I can track my food on this app. Makes it kind of useless.
2,Cannot adjust my fasting time when I fast longer than my selection.
2,"It all sounds right, but can I do it? I think I can!üòÜ"
2,Ni information and of guides if you don't buy
2,The same few recipes options!
2,Pogisigena
2,mong app c√≥ ph·∫ßn d·ªãch ti·∫øng Vi·ªát
2,I don't see anywhere that I can track my food on this app. Makes it kind of useless.
3,"I installed the app on 2 devices (phone & tablet). I paid for the yearly subscription and enabled Google Fit integration. But the 2 devices are out of sync! I had to enter my details and select a fasting schedule twice! And even though I set and have been following a daily schedule, it shows me that I have been fasting for over 2 days, as if it's expecting me to manually log the fasting start/end times each day!? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
3,"I've been testing this app for more weeks, and I like it. Is there an option to MANUALLY IMPORT or migrate fasting data from another app (LIFE Fasting, for example) or MANUALLY ADD the entries FOR MORE THAN THE LAST 10 DAYS? If this is impossible, then I will have to stick with the same apps that I've been using until now, because I really care about ALL MY FASTING HISTORY. (Your answer suggests that you didn't read the last part of my message. I've edited my review so you can see what I mean.)"
3,"Functional app, but way too many ads, and they're long ads. I could upgrade, but would have liked to try it out longer to see if I like it."
3,I don't get it. Why an app? Been doing IF for 13 months so far. While searching something else I saw and installed this app. Tons of info included. A bit of overwhelm. Simple solution skip one meal a day to limit eating during any eight hour window of your choosing. Mine is noon till 8p.m. No app needed. And no excuses preventing fasting. 'Oh I forgot to set a reminder today guess I'll fast tomorrow.'
3,"The ui is not very good but the constant information I love it. I can't do 24hr fasting in the app, it will not allow me I don't like it. If the app had one life time buy option for like 30$ I would buy it. You have a good app that can be awesome just needs some work."
3,A one time fee to get rid of ads would be sufficient. A monthly fee for information that can be found on the web for free or maybe an eBook just isn't it and kind of a insult to intelligence.
3,"The app is good, the weak point is the monotonous meal plan, that cannot be adjusted"
3,I eat at about 8 p.m. in the evening and then I don't eat until noon one the next day and I keep my meals small but I treat myself a little bit once in awhile I'm quite handicapped so I don't move an awful lot but I do believe in fasting and Dr.Oz also has spoken on this subject
3,Whenever I use the app it immediately drains all my battery out... Leap fitness group pls try to fix it
3,Too many/frequent Ads ü§≠
3,Good but please add vegetarian option.
3,"They are good they are great but when they are not, they really sucks."
3,"I fast 24hrs once a week. No support for that in here. Also, sources for your health claims would be more persuasive"
3,I bin fasting sins I was 8 it's my familie's tradition to fast wen your pretty big so for dose who's are doing dis for the first time believe me wen I say at first its gonna by hard but the more you do it you can see it's not dat hard so don't quit please take my word for it üëå
3,Custom area ... won't let me change anything. I want to do 40 hours
3,Nice app
3,"ok,"
3,"ok,"
4,"Log daily since 12-4-20. Features useful, but I does find it to be a very intuitive design. Not always obvious what is where, or that additional subscreens even exist - have to try tapping everything that could be a ""button"". Major glitch - every time I record a fasting start or stop time, click 'DONE' and verify that the info appears everywhere it should be, then close the app - when reopened, the last time recorded will be gone. I've had a completed fast disappear altogether.2-22 Improved-4‚òÜ!"
4,"This app is really good , I have been fasting for just a week and I can already see and feel a difference, it reminds me to stay hydrated and tracks my progress along the way, all while further educating me on both physical and mental well being. I find that it has helped me to lower my calorie consumption and I do feel alot lighter tbh. 10/10 recommend üòùüíÖ"
4,"Bang for the buck! App is really good. Though, meal planning menu is limited,still better than most IF tracking app in play store. Provides different IF plans depending on your comfort. Tracks water intake, weight tracking, and infos on IF planning. Giving 4 stars coz of the VERY limited menu. Hope they add more."
4,"I haven't experienced the final results of this yet but I am currently getting the results.I believe that someone who does this really correctly can get rid of obesity very easily. Another special thing about this is the look of it. It's very interesting.When you look at it, anyone wants to do it.This is a really good design. We can learn a lot more from this.Especially the scientific facts and why we should do this. This will be very successful if you add sleeping pattern and exercise pattern."
4,"This app is really helpful,motivational and easy to use üòä Just one thing i recommend is to make it possible to switch back and forth between the previos days instead of having to go back and look for the next days date ,this way i can read the notes i left easily (hope you understood what i mean üòÜ), Other than that its an amazing app ,I highly recommend it üòÄ Thank you so much for making this app ‚ù§"
4,Easy to navigate and straight forward app. I'd like to try the membership program but not sure if I want to invest in that just yet. Some content is locked without the membership.
4,"Have been using this app since 9 Feb 2020. I used to eat from boredom or just because working from home made it possible. The 1st week using 14/10 was really hard, but got thru it. The 2nd wk was easier an a few days i got to 20hrs cos i was busy so i switched up to 18/6 on the 3rd wk, was so easy. Currently 8mths later, i have energy to burn, i dont 'diet' i eat what i want, including cream buns. Ive lost 14kg an started building muscle again, if only it removed chronic pain! *App has a issue*"
4,"although the app itself is amazing, no ads and theres some premium features ofcourse. but it will not help u with any sort of weightloss. ive been on a diet of 1200 calories or less for months now with 16:8 fast and ive lost no weight, infact, ive remained my exact weight and sometimes im even heavier than before. it isnt smt to do when av.weight, mainly useful for overweight ppl or people who are looking for other benefits."
4,"It's an incredible helpful app, but such a shame that the notifications/reminders does work. The notification bar just disappears after a few hours of using the app."
4,"after using this app for weeks and eating only 3 meals a day plus my dessert after dinner with a snack allowed between each meal, and also working out throughout the week lightly, i lost 14 pounds. im really happy with my results and this is only using the 14-10 and 16-8 fasting times."
4,Great app to keep my going! I keep fasting and it is fun to track my time because when I finish I get a big celebration ‚ò∫Ô∏è! The only problem is that you have to pay for some big fasts so I fast out of the app I pause tej fast for a few hours but I am actually still fasting!
4,Actually a good fasting app. Only problem is I can't go premium because it says I haven't got Google play even though I downloaded the app from Google play. Edit its working now.
4,"Great clean app, does what is expected. Subscribed, but wished I noticed the widget only have water intake? Would be great to have a fast timer widget to quickly glance at."
4,"Great App., with lots of visual appeal, but also armed with ultra aggressive marketing elements that can be obstructive, attimes."
4,Very nice dashboard and helpful so far. Swhitchrd to premium to see what more i can get from the app
4,I does know if I paid I never used the app before and when I saw the premium page j unistaled the app so if I paid can j have my money back ty
4,Easy app to use just a shame there's no way to change water measurements from floz to ml.
4,I love this app then now i wanted to gain weight but i dont like the others so can you make a gaining app just like this
4,"Love this app.. lose my weight about 5 kg per month but when i start to uninstall, 1 gain weight againü§£"
4,Nice app wish it included 36 and 48 to 72 hours
4,Easy app to use just a shame there's no way to change water measurements from floz to ml.
4,Im still learning but its a great interface
4,"Ive only just installed this app, but i like it already. Q: Can i choose the day of the fast myself when im on a plan?"
4,This app is very useful and easy to use
4,"Very detailed ,,,love it"
4,Niceüòõüòõüòõüëçüëçüëç
4,Add landscape!!!
4,Wishlist
5,I really love this app. The fasting plans are good and can be adapted to a person's eating schedule. And all the essential information provided in the app really helps in staying informed and safe.
5,It is quite helpful.It guides me accordingly. However I am in Zimbabwe and failing to make a payment. Is there any other payment I can use. Like western union or world remit.
5,"Nice app, I would like it to be free as they do run adds. like the simple design. if it was like a one off payment of ¬£5 I'd probably pay for it."
5,It works pretty well and keep u updated and also encouraged you to push yourself harder
5,Very good. I can find no issues with this app. I does feel hungry in fact for this past week I want to continue with this every now and then fast. Thanks for including my thoughts.
5,I love the app. I just need to remember to turn on notifications.
5,I like the access to different articles for fasting on the app.
5,Great app tracks fasting hours gives great tips and telling what state your bodys in are only some of the features üòÉüòÉüòÉ
5,Good app as it shows how im doing and what stage I'm at. Thumbs up!
5,It really works for me... I have reduced 1.5kg in a week's time without tired or exercise üíù I haven't purchased the app since i want to give a try...but will purchase soon
5,It's a helpful tool to track your intermittent fasting I highly recommend it I'm using it since 2018 üôèüèª
5,This app makes it super easy to do intermittent fasting and tells you what stages of your fast you're in at all times. The free version is awesome. There are only occasional ads. Super satisfied with this app. Fantastic!
5,"Little to no ads, it's not shoved down your throat. It's a very simple app with fun facts about where you are in your fasting progress. I love the simple layout of this app, too. It's very nice for anyone already doing intermittent fasting or is just starting!"
5,Great app...it keeps track of how long you've been fasting so you does have too and you can create your own fast! Also love that it tells you what mode your body goes into the longer you fast! Great tips to keep you motivated too and also a water tracker!
5,"Great app! It tracks your weight loss, reminds you when you have fasted for too long, and it is overall just very good! If you are struggling with your weight, definitely download this!"
5,The best fasting app I have ever used. Easy and very informative.
5,Best app for weight loss
5,"This is the best app I've found to record flexible fasts. You can choose your start time, duration and end time. Very easy to use. You can also record other information like water intake and weight if you want to."
5,Very easy to use. The free trial has been more than enough.
5,"Really good and easy to use, it's helping me understand fasting better and what it does to my body. I've been feeling more energetic and less bloated since I started. Now I get to fast for 20 hours without even flinching. Update: 6 weeks and lost 10 lbs (nearly 5kg)"
5,"VERY HELPFUL! It keeps track of fasting/eating time for you, provides helpful information about what is happening to your body while fasting, reminds you to drink water, and just makes things easier! Very happy I found this!"

5,"Love this app. Day 1 was easy doing a 18:6 fast. App tracks u fasting time, great tips for encouragement, easy to set your start weight etc. Tells you when you go into ketosis (body use the fat reserves) friendly to use. Awesome."
5,"I love that it keeps me mindful of my fasting and helps me not to be Anxious about completing a fast. I love how it walks you through every stage, which is what helped encourage me to be more aggressive with my fasting."
5,This is the best app to lose weight. I can't believe that in just one week I lost 2 KG. It also encouraged me to drink more water because in the fasting period you can only drink water or herbal tea. This app deserves more than 5 stars. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
5,Immediately impressed! I could quickly input my data and it is so full of custom parts that it works well. Deleted my other app and paid the yearly for this one.
5,"Great app, lots of features in Free version. Reminders to Drink water. Shows time to eat, Time to Fast, how much time is left in each etc."
5,"It's amazing and very organized, it would be better if we could track what we eat outside of fasting too but it's great just the way it is also."
5,"I never thought I would write a review on Google playstore, but I really wanted to write a review about this app because it's that good. This app is really nice, everything is well defined and well specified. I saw a difference only in 2 days. I am fully satisfiedüåü"
5,Makes keeping track of fasting do easy!
5,"I am a little over a week using this program and I am enjoying it so far. My only problem is trying to add my water consumption every time, for some reason I does like the way it is setup. But the app is great."
5,"This app is the best, it keeps track of how long you've fasted, how much steps you've taken and how much water you drink. I haven't been able to find a better app 10/10 recommend."
5,"Great app to keep track of IF. I have been using the app for more than a month now, i have the pro version. Lost 7kg in 30 days, great insights and tips to support your IF. Recommend this for anyone planning to start IF. Thx developer"
5,"Brilliant. Helping me stay motivated and helping keep the fasts enjoyable. Yearly membership is a steal. Thank-you. P.s, only slight gripe is I can't transfer membership to my ios device from android. But this app still thoroughly deserves 5 stars."

5,Really detailed dashboard and the infomation about what's happening during the fast is great. I also love the big timer.
5,Please add the OMAD 23/1 that will Make this App the best fasting tracker ever. I have used both Zero and Life IF apps and this is just as good if not better. The interface is good.

5,Honestly its a great app it helps you throughput the day but it would help more if I put more effort in i sometimes cheat on the diet üôäüò≥üòÖbut its all good becayse this app helps you get back on track
5,This app helps in every aspects to improve health get a good physical appearence and everything. And because of that i gave it 5 stars because they deserve it.
5,"This is my first time fasting, in the beginning I did for 10 hours instead of the 14 hours, my blood sugar was getting low because I was sweaty and feeling light headed. It was time to eat."
5,It is awesome..Highly recommend this app...suberb...but please make it like 1 or 2 week challenge to lose 1or2 kg of weight it will be more good for me..so it wan't take much time for weight loss...
5,"It's a very good app! It was easy to use but, it would be best if their is an alarm as a reminder. But overall it's a pretty decent app!!"
5,"I love the app very much,it is very easy to follow,I love all the tips and tricks to stay focus in your plan."
5,As a first timer this app has really helped me keep track of my fasting and keeps me motivated with each passing hour. Great app!
5,"This app is helpful to track my progress and it will remind me to drink water throughout, which is great. Thanks"
5,Not had it for long but purchased the year. App seems stable and its encouraging to stick to the fast.

5,Such a big help on tracking my Intermittent fasting journey to healthy life!!thank u for this app!!

5,Thanks for getting me back into shape and it's worth your time Thanks again for all your hard work and hopefully it'll pay off in time in the next generations to continue to lose weight and stay fit for lifetime cause you may not always want stress in the work areas where others being hurt for no reasons for it at all so lose weight and stay away from workplaces that will stresses you out
5,It's a best option if it's hard for you to diet or go according to your plan. I recommend this. You'll even enjoy it!
5,It's a good app. I does really have much to say but the adds are kinda a problem
1,stupid app
1,Bad
1,Worst
2,Way too many adds. It's a nice app but if I have to wait 40 seconds and watch an add to see where I'm at in my fast - not worth it.
2,"There are way too many ads. You can't even get into the app without having to watch a whole ad. If you somehow ignore the ads, though, it's a fair app, easy to use and understand, and the fasting achievements makes it more fun."
2,It was a terrible app up until a few days ago. Now it's nothing but a bunch of pop up advertisements. Will be deleting this app after I finish my fast. Disappointed
2,"terrible App, but enough with all the ads! After Every action is an Ad, just plain greed. Very frustrating."
2,terrible app but I'm trying to cancel my subscription and I'm still getting charged!! I can't find end subscription option in settings please help
2,"I had to delete the app. After a year or so, I had to endure far too many ads just to track my progress. By the time it loaded, I forgot what I was attempting to do! The problem worse as time went on. Now, I'm searching for a new app."
2,This don't give me any update or notifications when to start or stop eating when I close the app. Therefore it's not really useful
2,"Used to be bad until now. I have to endure a full minute of advertisement to open the app. Now it is uninstalled, thank you very much."
2,"Ads are excessive, and things it advertises, like the body status are no where to be found."
2,"Had to remove a few stars. Can't get past the ad to get into the fasting app. It's in another language. I have everything set to English, not sure what's going on. Since I can't use the app, it goes from 5 stars down to 2."
1,"Ads are too frequent and too long. The photo ads that appear each time you open the app are acceptable, but those video ads where you have to wait five seconds to close them are a true test of patience."
1,can't get in too many ads that won't go away and if I close the app and open again.... another ad pops up
1,"Re: in-ter-mit-tent, adj., occurring at irregular intervals; not continuous or steady."
1,Add pop out every time I open it and try to log. Waiting time to close the app is even longer than the time I log my data. I ended up spending lots of time waiting to close the ads every day. It's very time consuming and annoying.
1,Incredibly long to boot up and lots of long ads just to pull up fasting timer.
1,"Using it for 55 days ,off last week it started paidzing, I uninstalled and reinstalled it lost all data despite it syncing,shows no badges, no awards this is frustrating."
1,"If you want a simple way to track a fasting option, this one will nickel and dime you. Tracking 1 meal a day fasting is a paid option, which is absurd."
1,"Nah fam. With the newest update, I can't set my own eating period unless I go paid. Rather, you purposefully made it more cumbersome to do so as I would need to change it every day? 5 star to 1 star, just like that. I'm uninstalling and finding a better app."
1,"It's ok to have ads, it's not ok to have LONG ads. More than 30 sec ad just to click a button? What happened to this app...."
1,"WAY too long to open due to having to watch ads 1st....had it for a long time, switching to something else."
1,"Even though I bought no ads months ago, they have put ads in every part of this app. It's complete trash now and unusable."
1,I just paid for premium and still get ads and asking to sign up from premium. I am about to reverse some charges on a card.
1,It used to be bad now its not informative and full of ads.
1,"The ads contains sexual content, I wrote multiple feedbacks no solution. Uninstalling"
1,We all put up with adverts to try apps out but this one does not allow you to remove the advert after having read and acknowledged it.
1,"Cannot select 17:7, also bombarded with pop-ups to upgrade. No, thank you."
1,I dont think this is accurate because when u r fasting you cant drink water and this app says that water does not break your fast this absolutly wrong because when you are fasting you are not allowed to drink or eat.it is bad for normal days but its not bad for ramadan.
1,It's been terrible... I jxt can't lose wait on my own buh with dis fasting app... I feel bad cos it's lyk a companion Dat guides me with weight loss
1,I fell like this shouldn't be an app because of how easily someone can develop an ED from this. So I don't think the app should be rated for everyone.
1,Too many nonsense ads. Don't waste your time.
1,Way too many advertisement and lagged out and stopped tracking
1,"Couldn't restore premium account, after i switched from ios to android"
1,A lot is behind monthly pay wall.
1,You guys should have never made this it is not ok to tell people to fast my 23 year old daughter tried it and she ended up in hospital in the ICU center so any one who is doing this please don't this is life threatening if I could give this 0 stars oh don't sought me I would
1,Worst app ever ssly its so bad it tells me to leave one meal like ssly
1,I don't have money for get premium
1,I don't have money for get premium
1,Be careful or you will be charged large sums of money
1,Why? I can't restore my progress
1,I don't like it.
1,No notification
1,Why can't the sound be turned off for ads?! I've looked in settings and can't figure it out. Never had an app like this just open with sound blasting and no option to mute. Definitely not using this anymore if that's the case...
1,Poorly explained or non-existent instructions. Functionality inadequate. Pointless app. It's easier just to set alarns on your phone to remind you when to start/stop fasting.
1,It's a player of unclosable advertisements. Very frustrating when you have to force close an app due to persistent ads. The X button does not function and is for decoration only.
1,I paid for a monthly subscription and was bumped off of it after 2 weeks. The app goes back into suggesting I go premium. Google still shows that I am still subscribed. Not sure if this is an error or if this is robbery.
1,Update. It's still awful! The time edit feature is so clumsy to use and the design doesn't allow simple typed input of the time. I'm now looking for a better fasting tracker. Plenty around.
1,"Too much adds :( close button do nothing, I press it but nothing happens, so I need to close app and reopen it to be able to use. App is basically just a timer but the splash screen loading time is insainly slow."
1,"Purchase is too much money. paid version was ok at first, then ads start popping up and have to wait for ad to finsh before using app. Deleted. Using stopwatch built into smartphone. Works as well."
2,"it's glitchy after recent update. When you end your fast, you cannot adjust the time back if tou need to. It does not give you a ""today"" selection, which ruins your data and your stats. This didn't used to happen. I hope it's fixed soon or I'll have to find a different tracker app."
2,"The app looks bad and works well, but the ads are too numerous and too intrusive. Especially the video ones when you open the app. They aren't skipable, and they seem to cause a delay opening the app (maybe while they load)?"
2,"The ads are way too intrusive. I don't mind ads, that's how you get paid I get it, but when I'm in a hurry and trying to open the app and an ad plays right off the bat, I'm finding another solution"
2,"So obnoxious. I just needed a simple fasting tracker (I've been intermittent fasting for years). Instead, I got a busy UI, too many popups, and annoying questionnaire filled with obnoxious messages I don't need. Two stars for not selling my data."
2,A lot of the options are locked behind a paywall. OMAD is also locked behind a Paywall. They give the option for custom but you can only set a start and have to manually stop the fast. I will be look at other options.
2,"It's a decent app if you pay for the subscription. Feels like it's made for kids, though, as every day you finish you get a million ""badges"". I just wanted a simple fasting timer."
2,"Money hungry app. Way too many ads, and takes forever to open. Note for the owners, do you really need to have ads when you have so many subscribers. Make the UI experience the best and see what will happen."
1,"Th y did not interact with me. But quietly took my money behind the scenes. I have no order. I downloaded the ""paid"" app"
1,Used to be very bad before introducing overly invasive and unreasonably frequent advertisements.
1,"Everytime I jumped to a different screen, an ad popped up. This was irritating and difficult to negotiate thru the app. I understand that this is a way for revenue but I spent more time closing windows than on the app. Sheesh. Going back to Fastic."
1,"So far so good. I like the app, not so crazy about the ads. **UPDATE- Had to delete app, I can't sit through a 30 sec ad to just log in, that's bananas. Who wants to watch an ad before they can even get onto app to log info ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,Pretty basic app unless you want to pay $$$ and of course theres ads which are annoying. We always love having a skip the dish ad pop up in the last couple of hours of fasting. Not.
1,"Nice app in terms of the information it provides however, the paid version is full of unskippable ads every time you switch screens. Had to uninstall as I'm not interested in paying for a subscription service to remove the ads. Wish they offered a regular purchase option."
1,"This app is completely unusable if you don't pay. The advertising is extremely intrusive, you can't close out of it, the ads cover the whole screen and won't let you close you of them for a good bit. It's much too annoying, I'm giving up after a day."
1,I tried turning on the notification and the phone non stop vibrating. Overall the app is easy to use! I tried to uninstall and install back the app. All my data lost! My trackings for a month lost! I paid the premium and i have to start over again
1,Not usable on Pixel 6. It is not possible to skip or close any of the ads. Even when they've played the close button does not work. I have to close the whole app and reopen it every time an ad is played.
1,This is really freaking hard to figure out how to work. I'm constantly just going around poking things stop how to stop the feeding program. I can't even change the times if it's minutes plus or minus without it starting the whole what do you want your program to be again.
1,"Takes very long to open, not usable if you just want to track your fasting. For setup, I gave my last and first meal and they gave me exactly the time between the two for fasting. Most buttons which promise info just lead to the pay version. Useless app..."
1,"I uninstalled this because of the new ""full page"" style of ads, just like the word and picture game apps, not because of the fasting content. Now the app still shows up on my update list. Hopefully it will go away. I do not appreciate having to complain."
1,"I am a paying customer, it is not worth the price. That being said, a paid use would not have any issues with the app. I tried custom plans, twice, and each time my progress was removed at the end of the week, I contacted support but no response. Get another app."
3,"Love this app overall, but I feel it can use some improvments like account syncing. I would love if the app synced across all my devices so I can keep track of my status."
3,i really wanted to get fit so i downloaded some apps this was one of the i have only had it for 3 days and it was my first time fasting. I forgot what i was doing so i started to eat. i rememberd after i ate i was suposed to be fasting. so i clicked stop fasting and put when i stopped eating i went back and it didnt stop it i tried to put it in a few nore times it dosent work.
3,Starting in times keep changing and Icon for app disappears after one day
3,"I installed the app on 2 devices (phone & tablet). I paid for the yearly subscription and enabled Google Fit integration. But the 2 devices are out of sync! I had to enter my details and select a fasting schedule twice! And even though I set and have been following a daily schedule, it shows me that I have been fasting for over 2 days, as if it's expecting me to manually log the fasting start/end times each day!? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
3,"I've been testing this app for more weeks, and I like it. Is there an option to MANUALLY IMPORT or migrate fasting data from another app (LIFE Fasting, for example) or MANUALLY ADD the entries FOR MORE THAN THE LAST 10 DAYS? If this is impossible, then I will have to stick with the same apps that I've been using until now, because I really care about ALL MY FASTING HISTORY. (Your answer suggests that you didn't read the last part of my message. I've edited my review so you can see what I mean.)"
3,"Functional app, but way too many ads, and they're long ads. I could upgrade, but would have liked to try it out longer to see if I like it."
3,I don't get it. Why an app? Been doing IF for 13 months so far. While searching something else I saw and installed this app. Tons of info included. A bit of overwhelm. Simple solution skip one meal a day to limit eating during any eight hour window of your choosing. Mine is noon till 8p.m. No app needed. And no excuses preventing fasting. 'Oh I forgot to set a reminder today guess I'll fast tomorrow.'
3,"The ui is not very good but the constant information I love it. I can't do 24hr fasting in the app, it will not allow me I don't like it. If the app had one life time buy option for like 30$ I would buy it. You have a good app that can be awesome just needs some work."
3,A one time fee to get rid of ads would be sufficient. A monthly fee for information that can be found on the web for free or maybe an eBook just isn't it and kind of a insult to intelligence.
3,"The app is good, the weak point is the monotonous meal plan, that cannot be adjusted"
3,I eat at about 8 p.m. in the evening and then I don't eat until noon one the next day and I keep my meals small but I treat myself a little bit once in awhile I'm quite handicapped so I don't move an awful lot but I do believe in fasting and Dr.Oz also has spoken on this subject
3,Whenever I use the app it immediately drains all my battery out... Leap fitness group pls try to fix it
3,Too many/frequent Ads ü§≠
3,Good but please add vegetarian option.
3,"They are good they are great but when they are not, they really sucks."
3,"I fast 24hrs once a week. No support for that in here. Also, sources for your health claims would be more persuasive"
3,I bin fasting sins I was 8 it's my familie's tradition to fast wen your pretty big so for dose who's are doing dis for the first time believe me wen I say at first its gonna by hard but the more you do it you can see it's not dat hard so don't quit please take my word for it üëå
3,Custom area ... won't let me change anything. I want to do 40 hours
3,Nice app
3,"The free app is ok, not too many ads and short. Does a good job reminding you to get water, recording times, weight. But many other apps do the same. Hence, the three stars."
3,"Just completed my first day of fasting, doing the 16/8. It notified me that I made it, I click on it, it asked me when my last meal was(yesterday at 7pm) and it says it has not been long enough to be considered fasting. It's been 16 hours. -.- But now according to the app I have never completed a fast. Edit: when it's asking you to note last meal, it's under the assumption you already ate to start the eating on the next day wish it was clearer on what it's asking for. Avoid confusion for people"
3,Been using this app for a few months and just decided pay for the no ads version today. It's good. My only issue is that the data did not pull over from my old phone. Is there a way to set up an acct or transfer data? Please reach out to me as I can see my progress history now. üò¢ üôè At the moment taking stars off for that.
3,"A little too detailed and a little too invasive for my comfort. There appears to be no way to control personal data once you have it. I could see some folks liking the heavy coaching, but I do not like it."
3,It reminds me to hydrate. Keeps track of my fasting time. I like the app. It is doing exactly what I would expect it to do. Only a few plans available though unless you upgrade to premium.
3,"I'm not getting any notification reminders besides the initial start time one. Then say 62 hours has gone by, I'd have to open the app before it asks ""are you still fasting?"" As in...""have you been fasting a full 62 hours? Go you!"" Like, no, I haven't been fasting for 62 hours straight. Some kind of reminder to ask when the fasting plan you're on has ended just for the day.. would be good to stay on track."
3,"The app works well but the 3 stars are for having to double tap, past their ads, to get out of the app. Its VERY annoying. I wouldn't recommend this one, and I'm looking for another app for that reason."
3,"Annoying that I can't delete or change old data as I put in my weight wrong and now it looks like I've lost a bunch of weight in a day just because I corrected it. It's a good, basic app but this is annoying."
3,"Honestly this is a great tracker and supports you throughout the entire process. But the reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it can also make you feel guilty and more self concious feelings come up when that happens. After my friends realized I was on a type of diet, they asked me why I wanted to do that, bc I should feel comfortable with what I look like. I don't think it means to, but the app makes you think that you're willing to starve yourself bc you want to look more ""pretty"""
3,"This app should be able to stop and start based on the time you set. You should be able to hear an alarm for start and end times. Instead, it makes you manually do this and then shifts the time if you don't stop the clock. Please fix this on the app."
3,I really liked the app. But within days of using it you begin to have to go though multiple ad screens that are annoying and you can't close them for a period of time. I'm uninstalling the app.
3,"I purchased the Premium and used it for 24 days and didn't lose an ounce. What they don't tell you is that if you're post menopausal it can actually be worse for you to intermittent fast than to do regular eating. If you're hormones aren't just right, they can get even more messed up by fasting and that is what appears to be happening to me. I feel worse today than I did when I started a month ago. I'm done."
3,"Love even a free version. Going to get a subscription. P.s. I regret I wasted money on subscription. No 12/12 fasting, custom was there anyway but it does not have notifications, menu is a just ""Maggie diet"" that isn't healthy, I also did not find an option for 1 day break."
3,It's ok for a basic app. I've had better free apps. You have to pay to read articles (google it instead - free and probably more info) and there is only a water tracker widget rather than a widget that keeps track of hours. I'm going to keep searching and ditch this one. Response to devs: I want a free app. Health should not only be accessible to those who have money. I found a better app and I can google articles if need be. Thanks.
3,"It doesn't seem to offer a connection to the Fitbit app to import weight, etc. Otherwise I like the reminders to drink water and the easy interface."
3,"Hi, pls unsubscribe me from premier . I don't want to have 350 rupees deducted every month . I haven't used this app in a long time I do not want to give any feedback. I want to cancel subscription. Any reason why u did not give that option to cancel subscription. Can mine immediately. This is my second request in a row in 2nd month My 4th request to unsubscribe I have done what u have asked me, even sent an email. Am I unsubscribed yet ?? No response from the team at all but taking money"
3,"Even though notifications to do so are on, the app doesn't give me indicators if when my fasting period is due to start/stop so i have to mentally track times on my own. It kind of makes the app redundant as a result."
3,"I would have rated this a 5 Stars based on how informative and motivating this tracker is for fasting! But being that I pay for the premium option, and I'm getting bombarded with ads... that's not okay! Shouldn't paying into your app bypass the ads?!"
3,"Unless you join the Premium version, this app offers little more than a timer and history of your fasts. When you try to see one of the hints pages, you are transported to a premium sign-up page. Without knowing more about what hints are available, not biting. Figure The Complete Book of Fasting by Dr.. Jason Fong offers more information for about the cost of a yearly membership to this ap."
3,"Good but needs more options for trial users. Also, when I first started using this (I'm 10 days in), I was able to edit how much water I drank on previous days and now I can't. For the life of me can't figure out why, and usually I'll forget to count all the water I drank that day, so it's necessary for me to go back and correct it the next day. Please fix this and I will pay and give 5 stars!!!"
3,"So far, tracking of the fasting is working well. However, I would have liked to have been able to track food as well and have had to download another app for this purpose. Would be must better to have it all in one place. I do have the premium paid version."
3,I installed this app just today.. It looks & sounds good.. I want to join the fasting program... I selected to pay one month premium of Rs. 350/- which is already debited from my bank account through GPay.. But my premium subscription is not reflecting on the app.. The app is still asking me to buy the premium pack.. Why so..? What about my paid money..? Kindly resolve..
3,"Wish there were more ""free articles"" to help out. I want to see more content to see what they have to truly offer those of us who are a step above beginners not quite well versed.... Really see if those tid bits are worth the subscription cost!"
3,Very supportive and informative but I wish it was easier to set your own fasting schedule. Other apps are a bit easier in this respect and perhaps this could be improved so you can add other times/days
3,"Oh, I downloaded because I thought it will help me to take proper diet after fasting however, this app is not for Muslims as it says; one can drink water,tea or coffee when feel thirsty and it says one can listen to music to distract themselve from fasting. Hence, I won't recommend this app to a Muslim no offence. I gave it a 3 star because I'm neutral."
3,"Hi. I've just downloaded this app and need to improvise. I hope it works, but is it possible that you could make it more flexible? I work night shifts and eat at 1am when working (which is weekends). I eat at around 9pm when I'm not (which is 3 weekdays per week). I also do not eat breakfast or lunch. My improvisation comes from my eating period of when I am working, and when I'm not. Thoughts?"
3,I just want to say that the app is great but you're encouraging people to continue their fast even for 3 days which can be really harmful for the body. 18 hrs fasting and user will only reach level 6 out of 11 levels. People will try to achieve higher levels so they will literally starve themselves. Please lower your levels or put a lock above 18 hrs in free app mode. Thanks
3,Loved this app until the ads open with sound every time even with my phone on silent. Not good if you don't want an ad blaring & disturbing everyone around you. Didn't mind the silent ads but getting rid of it b/c of the sound on ones.
3,The full screen ads are terrible. Displaying ads isn't the problem. Displaying ads that take the whole screen and prevents you from using the app for its tended purpose is.
3,"It was great at first and helped me lose a little weight but then it started making me gain weight even when I wasn't eating much. I wanted to lose weight, not gain weight. And I've been keeping myself hydrated throughout the day while fasting but I got real bad sick the other day so I stopped using it. Such a shame too cuz it really is a good app and it was helping me but it doesn't anymore. Not doing this out of spite, just being honest and to warn others about the dangers of it"
3,"Seems like a decent app, but I uninstalled due to very interrupting video advertisements which pop up quite frequently. There are other equally good app options out there which don't have video ads!"
3,"I have special dietary needs. There is no where for me to indicate that or get recipes based on my them. Also I only eat one meal a day. I can't indicate that either so it thinks I have breakfast at 1800, lunch at noon, and dinner at 1700. garbage. Its got a cute counter and hasn't crashed. Thats the best I can say. Not worth it."
3,"The ads are not too intrusive, but 8 am recording when I start or stop, only to find out it did not save. Happened quite a few times don't know if I am doing something wrong or the app has errors"
3,"There is no exercise plan, t no diet plan! You have to resort to other apps! Not even tracking your water! Ony tracks fasting and feeding times! Only give advice about drinking the water and exercise, If you do exercise keep it light on your fasting will the only advice."
3,"Great free app. V useful, however there are a shocking level of intrusive adverts that switch on and play sound even with volumme on phone switched off. . Not so discrete when at work etc. Will continue using for now and see how annoying they get."
3,"I have no idea how to use this app. I found the app in the morning,before breakfast time. I sign up and as a begginer i chose the easiest plan. They calculated it and it says fasting till 11pm.. Really? Its only 9:30am. So when am i supposed to eat? At night,while i am sleeping? I would like it to be the other way round. I thought it was made for beginners as well. Is there anything i did wrong?"
3,"The bottons to edit the fasting time are really annoying, have it fixed and I will change my rating"
3,I really enjoy the app and I even payed for all the extra tips and things. It's perfect for telling you where you're at in the process but I can't give 5 stars because it's completely geared toward woman. If gives you option for male and female but all the tips are woman oriented and it left me a little disappointed.
3,Great! Exept for the notifications...If I have notifications on Vibrate it continues to buzz indefinitely until I turn it on silent or soft reset the phone. Which means I don't have easy access to the tracker while fasting.
3,"I was charged $27 and the app showed 14.99. I contacted customer service and it took 3 weeks for them to reply for my request. The app is good and very useful, just the menu needs improvement since it only has few options even when you pay premium."
3,"I paid for the year and so far not seeing the perks of the paid version over the free. I also wish the multi week plans would just automatically continue. Unless I'm doing it wrong, I start the plan and on Friday it's completed. Then I manually have to go and select the next week."
3,"It would be really cool if all plans were free, or maybe at least 10in2 and autophagy but except that it's a great app for beginners because as I said not everything is free so you have to pay for more advanced plans"
3,"Wanted to 5 star this app, every reminder feature and information display is logical & helpful. However, the inability to continue a fast for a few hours when desired is frustrating. Maybe I'm missing something?"
3,"Nothing special. Free version is pretty basic, ads are a little obnoxious for an app with a premium option. Couldn't sync data to new phone, so I'll try out similar apps instead."
3,I'm confused. The photos displayed on the app to encourage you to install are not the photos on my app plus apart from the timer part what else is there? Am I missing something on the app. I paid for 6 months but surely it can't just be a timer. Can anyone advice?
3,"It's good, but I have to reset it everyday. It won't do the same hours for each day. I ended up accidentally deleting all my previous fasting record trying to find how to do it. Frustrating.."
3,Honestly I'm only on my 2nd day. I don't know why apps always ask you to rate them before you have a single clue. How much you like it or don't like it. But so far I like it.
3,I have the basic version and much of it works well. I enables me to track when I'm eating and when I'm fasting. I will fast longer than my usual 16 hours ( which is not offered by this app) but I don't believe frequent longer fasting is positive for most people. Every day it feels as though I have failed if I break my fast and eat. Prior to using this app I successfully lost 45 pounds over 18 months by fasting 16 hours per day. Now I'm feeling guilty for eating. Not healthy
3,"Why is it always running in the background? Push notifications would be sufficient for this app, but it is always running in the background with an icon in my task/notification bar. Im well aware that I should be eating at 1pm and fasting by 9pm..ü§®"
3,Good but notifications aren't working. The bar at the top of notifications is cool but doesn't update or let you know when to stop/start fasting when other apps do this.
3,"I have just started using this app. I really like the way it is set out, but why does it keep changing my settings back to kg and fl oz. Every time I go into it I am changing to lbs and ml...it is driving me mad and may well end up with me deleting altogether!"
3,I like it. It does what it says. The ads are annoying. And the widget for hydration doesn't stay in the unit I change it to. I'm probably going to try another app.
3,The problem I have with this app is they don't create a plan for you at all as indicated. They ask how much you want to lose and at what level you want to fast/lose weight. Then they tell you they've created a plan for what you chose and to subscribe to see it. After paying you'll discover they didn't create any plan for you at all and you're on your own to choose which fasting plan you want- nothing tailored to you at all! Disappointing!
3,I subscribed to premium but it doesn't reflect on the app. I still see ads and can't access other features. Its sad because I have been using this for months already and what happened when I subscribed to premium? Kindly fix it.
3,"Too many annoying ads. Ok, we get it with the premium version, but you make your own app unusable without the premium version in this way. They're tons of other apps on the market."
3,"Good app, however it is highly geared towards women. Most all images are of women most all recommendations And guides are for women. Such as "" As a woman how to _____"" Definitely just kind of leaves men out. No real suggestions on how to handle intermittent fasting if you are a burly man or a skinny man... Not even to mention that it is incredibly important for weight loss and overall health for men to watch Muscle fatigue, muscle consumption, And the best ways to keep bulk and strength..."
3,"I gave 3 stars since I am confused about the time of fasting reflected in my record. I started fasting 5 days ago and I always complete my 12 hours of fasting but my record says that I just did fasting for 9 hours, 12 hours etc. I know I completed the 14 hours daily since the app notifies me whenever the time alloted for my fasting is done. Please enlighten me about this. It's not helping in motivating me. Thank you"
3,"From what I can see, the app is just a timer...with lots and lots of ads to get you to upgrade to their premium. No info provided without upgrade. I could do a timer on my phone's clock."
3,"Each time the app is opened, an ad appears, and most times you will be forced to listen before closing the ad. This very annoying. The tracking is fine, but I am removing the app."
3,"So far, so good, no issues. Do wish there were more fasting hour options"
3,Going with result oriented approach and will come back to rate 5 stars once I get the results.
3,I like it I really do only problem is I can't afford premium recipes üòÇ
3,"Don't know what is happening but whenever i start the timer in night , And check in morning there is no timer started"
3,"The app overall is very nice, easy to use and flexible. However the water reminder cannot be switched off, it's really annoying!"
3,"While this app has some interesting information and features, it requires a paid subscription for more than basic function. It eats battery like crazy, and is not easy to use."
3,"Decent app, does the basics, but the ""recent fasts"" shows weird numbers. I fasted 12h, 16h, 16h, 24h and it shows 13.7h, 19.6h, 17.7h, 22h. It be nice if there was a website option to pair with the app."
3,"Not Automated. I would love for an alarm when fasting is about to begin, you can then accept to start at the scheduled time, or delay. Otherwise, it's good and easy to use."
3,Its basic but hard to use. I try setting it manually and it doesn't do what I input!! I upgraded & paid for 6 months and nothing changed from the basic free one?? I'm So confused and irritated!!!! I spent money on this app...for what???
3,"Very useful app, I just love it! Been doing my 72hrs fasting and I have lost quiet a significant amount of weight, very easy to use, I just dont like the adverts!"
3,"Too many Bugs. This app never works correctly. Keep saying I'm fasting 24 hrs after I've ended fasting period. I have to constantly manually changes my start and ending period. I was hoping the paid app would work properly, foolish me for buying this app. What is the refund policy?"
3,"I would have given this 4 stars, but the ads are so annoying, I have to close my app once to get past the Facebook ad and then open it again to get past it. I will uninstall if this continues."
3,"Great to use,it does not give alot of plans because some are on premium and you can only do beginners fasting and advanced , if you want intermediate you have to pay,I love the tips and triks that they give for fasting"
3,"Not bad. My only beef so far is the app is for whatever reason bad at telling time. For example if my fast started at 8pm and ends at 12pm the following day, it should be 16hr0min. However half of the time my fast will be 15hr59m. Not that it's a huge deal, but it throws my fast off by 1 minute later if I set it to 16hours manually when ending the fast. So I have to go back and edit the start time, but still 16 hours on the dot registers as 15:59. So I need to go edit the start time to 7:59."
3,"I find it difficult to set my preferences. I can't change when i start or end a fast with the custom setting. It's a bit fiddly. I am better off with a watch, really."
3,I really liked the app but did not enjoy or appreciate being bombarded with soft porn ads of half naked women. If this was supposed to inspire me to purchase the ad free version it failed...I simply uninstalled your app!
3,With the update an add pops up as soon as you open it. You have to wait for the option to skip. I didn't mind the adds before but this is too annoying to keep using the app
3,Would have given it a five stars but the ads are too much
3,"The app is great and easy to use, but there are too many ads.. I find these ads too annoying, especially the videos, so for that reason, I decided to uninstall it."
3,"Good app, but the widget is broken. When I start a fast and forget to activate the widget beforehand, it will show the wrong elapsed time. It should show an elapsed time based on what you input as your starting point, not when you activate the widget. My current fast has been ongoing for 15 hours, not 5 minutes."
3,"Very busy UI, lots going on with not a lot of substance. Pop up adverts are of junk food, not great considering it's a diet app. Other than that, does what it's meant to."
3,The insights use to be free and extremely helpful...I really liked that. Without the insights it really is...as one person stated...a glorified timer.
3,"Great app, so informative, tells you what fasting status you are at, however, this is draining my battery quicker than other apps. For the devs, if you can change it so it doesn't run constantly and drain battery I will be willing to download again. Thanks."
3,"Not bad for single day fasting, but it refuses to keep me on the weekly plans. It's like it just deletes that moment I was like ""yeah, I do want to fast for 16hrs a day off the foreseeable future."" It looks nice and is educational though."
3,"I just paid for the premium subscription..however once I did, I wasn't truly satisfied, don't believe it's worth the money. I can't figure out how to cancel the subscription. I've looked everywhere in the app and there is no way to end subscription from the app. Can someone please explain this and how I can?"
3,Very good for keeping on track and easy to use. Would be nice if there was trial for the premium or I little bit more free modes or content. 3/5 is fair with that many ads lol
3,"A bit confuse with the plan, for beginning should have suggestion. And, I understand free apps have ads, but it TOO MUCH ads. Everything I click, the ads come out. It so ignored."
3,"Loved this app, I've been using it for 3 months but now it won't update its dates and times so I have been unable to accurately record and track my fasting time and eating periods. It still has the date from 2 days ago and nothing further."
3,"I've used this app for a while. But now when I use it the Ads are very annoying. They pop up every 10 seconds. I use to like the app before. It had more features, but now it's just annoying."
3,It's an okay app. I like how friendly it is. It's very easy to work. I just wish it had a notification (with sound) that tells me my fasting is ending and when it starts.
3,"It's helpful for keeping track of hours & water intake, but the diet suggestions (at least for me) were unsustainable and unrealistic, as I could not tailor it to my food allergy & blood sugar restrictions."
3,Great app except you have to manually reset your plan every week and it's really annoying also there are a bunch of ads. There are othere apps that don't have these down sides.
3,Is an ok app. I've been using this alongside another fasting app. There are too many ads. The app is too basic to entice me to want to pay $2.99 to get rid of the ads.
3,3 star only because theres no edit to adjust the time. I used to have The other fasting app and I can edit and move the time. This app no you can't! I purchase 1 month subscription and that's it I'm out!
3,"The app itself works fine, more than fine actually. My only issue is with the ads, more specifically, the amount of them. There's way to many ads."
3,"Good app, but too many ads and only half the options are free. It's handy and very informative and educational, but also a bit annoying with the money grubbing."
3,"1st day seems overall easy use. Pet pev on this app is the fact it only rates your weight success based on BMI which is a completely inaccurate form of weight measurement expecially for high muscle mass individuals like me. BMI hasnt been accurate for me since long before highschool when i 1st started working out. It would be nice to at least be able to disable the BMI from being seen. Or if possible have a more accurate way to track my fat level like body fat percentage, even manual% entry."
3,"Moderately good. Unless I missed it, there's no option to correct entry for fasting and feeding times. No way to correct a whoops entry."
3,"It's good, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a fasting timer that runs automatically. It seems you have to manually start/stop the timer."
3,I like the app but it asks me to choose a fasting plan and enter my times every day. It's really annoying that it isn't remembering the fasting and times that I've chosen.
3,"I'm not sure how this works. Also the hydrate, fast and eat notifications disappear after dinner time and only comes back when I open the app."
3,Cool app but I'm not sure if fasting actually helps. I'm recording my natural fasting patterns which seem to be around 13-16h w/o food per day over this first week. That's higher than recomended I think but that's just how my body works But my weight continues to maintain or fluctuate 2-3 pounds up or down. I never actually lose weight so I don't think fasting actually works. I'm reading everywhere that your body actually holds onto fat if you don't eat so isn't this abit counter productive?
3,Way too many ads!! Every time you open the app ads start popping up. Have to go to your restart back button to get the app to open and even then ads keep popping up. Frustrating app.
3,"I like the app but I thought once you set a fasting time it would automatically do it everyday. When I logged on this morning it asked if I wanted to start another fast. So instead of saying I'm in a fast right now, it's telling me when my next one starts."
3,"It's a great app, except that it has some false misleading information. It claims that your body will only start to break down amino acids and convert them into energy after 3 days of fasting where in fact that starts happening after the 24h mark, so if you fast for longer than 24h just know that the weight you're going to lose from there is from your muscle mass, not fat. Also, the water reminder is annoying, I personally can drink up to 1L at one sit, I don't need a reminder every hour"
3,This app starts off fantastic and free for weeks and sets one off on a good path but then sadly stutters and stops being effective automatically. Perhaps to encourage a pay plan. I just add the hours to my last evening meal if my last bite is 8pm and I am 16/8 8pm to 8am is 12 hours plus 4 more hours is noon. I put that in my phone timer and have ZERO food until that timer goes off. My eating window begins at the timer with a banana. Nice not to think about food.
3,Great app. I love the details on hourly zones. I understand the ads are required but they seem a little excessive. Just my opinion.
3,"I like how the app lets me know what phase I am in, and love the reminders. Biggest downside is, I am not one who carries their phone everywhere. Would be a 5 star app, if i could connect the reminders to my Samsung watch."
3,"What is premium? What new things are offered on a monthly basis that justifies a monthly charge? I dont understand the business model, its a glorified timer, how is it not just 1 payment and you own it. Why is it a monthly subscription??"
3,I've been intermittent fasting for 7 days straight. Yet it says I've completed one day. It doesn't seem to track. Only counts down to your next deadline.
3,"Really good app, only letdown is I can't find a way to start the app automatically after a phone reboot so have to manually open the app to get reminders."
3,Not sure how i feel about it. I dont like how it resets after every fast and I have to constantly pick a plan. It throws me off.
3,"The Covid snippet in the ""immune cells regenerate"" section is absolutely ridiculous and out of place. You really should consider removing that. Otherwise, the app is decent to track a fast."
3,Great except for the ads
3,"I installed this app, and I found.it really hard to navigate and I couldn't understand the custom thing. I put it in to start fasting at 12pm and it was saying I had already fasted for 9 hours, which makes no sense because I just downloaded this app-"
3,"This app added water tracker and it's very useful. It would be great if there is edit function as in ""Water Drink Reminder"" app. I need to update my water tracker for yesterday."
3,Seems OK but I tried to start a new plan and it said I'm currently fasting and to end it however my app says I'm in my eating window. There was another bug where the date was wrong when trying to manually change the dates
3,This app is hard to navigate. It doesn't explain how to start times or end early or extend fasted time. Not much advise or help to find on app. I might look for a different one.
3,The premium version is supposed to come with recipes but there are none. I have clicked everywhere. Really expensive app for that you get. My wife had a free app with the same features. Blah.
3,"Seems helpful enough, but I'm going to set a daily alarm and not eat after the alarm goes off instead. Thanks for the idea."
3,I have paid a yearly subscribtion but it billing me every month for 17.9 p. ?? I have sent the evident to the feedback and got an answer that it might be monthly payment ... I again sent the evident that it was written 'yearly' by email. Please answer me.
3,"It is what it is, a tracker, so you pretty much have to reset it after each fast but it help you track your fasting and feeding period"
3,Love the fasting stages. BUT this app isn't very user friendly. I am doing 36 hour fasts 3x per week. But it won't allow me to add a fasting time from now (8pm) till midnight because I already fasted from midnight last night to 6 am. Bit annoying and I wish I hadn't paid for it because there are better apps out there.
3,"App seems decent, but I do not support the subscription based service model for software. Sorry, but I have too many services now that want me to make regular payments in perpetuity."
3,The app itself is great but... I paid for 6 months of premium hoping it would bring me more features but it didn't. I am also still getting ads come through... So what has my 10 pound paid for exactly?
3,I dislike that it only tracks water. Other apps will allow you to enter beverages and adjust intake accordingly. Meal plans are ridiculous. Like half grapefruit and boiled eggs.
3,"I've been using for about a week now and like the simplicity but I'm confused about the hours it's showing. I've been doing 8:16 and haven't cut more than 1 fast short (and even that only by a few minutes) but I've got days that show I fasted for under 16 hours. Am I doing something wrong, or is the app?"
3,There is something wrong with the app. I can no longer choose Today to end my fast. I can choose yesterday and the days before but not today. It's been happening for about 4 days. Super disappointed.
3,Just downloaded the app on my android and on my wife's iPhone. Why is it different for the iPhone? It says after 7 days it will cost $39 per year? Wth? It didn't give me this obstacle on my android. I just emailed the developer so hopefully there's a work around and then I can update the rating.
3,It keeps me disciplined and helps me prolong my fasting.. however.. Creepy add to get paid for vaccinating keeps popping up... Also.. monthly/annual payments to get full access put a bad taste in my mouth... Will be trying another app
3,"Premium monthly subscription to read articles about weight, some plans need premium, some gadgets etc, Its kinda hard to learn how to fast and what you can and cant eat when they want 4 dollars to tell you some stuff you can google. Like ""dont drink milk"""
3,This would be great if it wasn't so glitchy. Doesn't register when I stop or start fasting and there's no way to program that effectively afterwards. Uninstalled.
3,"App is good for tracking IF progress, the ads have been slowly increasing. Getting close to deleting and switching to another app."
3,"If I was to rate the app for how well it is made I'd give it 5 stars, but my dear god. Ads upon ads upon ads and then some. Every 5th click on the app is an ad for the love of god."
3,"It's good for beginners. I was looking for something like advanced because I do 24 hour fasting. I hope there's also 24, 28, 32, 36 hours and so on because I want to challenge myself to fast longer"
3,"Main reading should show days as well as hours and minutes, not just hours, if im in my 14th day fast and it shows only hours...why would i want to waste my time trying to convert into days? Id like to see it on the screen, Days large font, and next to it small font of hours and seconds"
3,"When I edit my fasting from the current day, it sets it to yesterday with no option to put it back to today. Other than that I really liked the app til I got this bug."
3,"I bought premium, made no difference....I click on my premium and only tells me difference between premium and non. I still have the same fasting patterns....I'll rate 5 star once I see the actual benefits of premium"
3,"Does it not let you choose what type of diet you have? I paid for a year plan, I'm vegan, and everything I see has meat or dairy in it. So the ""meal"" option doesn't really do me any good. I'm a bit disappointed."
3,I set it for 18-6 with my own hours but once the fast is over it just keeps going with the fasting time. Would have been great if it worked right.
3,"I should be able to set the ""end time"" of my fast during custom fasting. I can see other users have also recommended that, please add that feature."
3,"I'm not getting reminders for my fast. I have it set up, and I am getting water reminders. Would be a great app if I could get reminders."
3,I was enjoying the app until it became very obvious that I was being hijacked by ads like they're going out of fashion! I am unsubscribing as it is just getting too much now.
3,I liked this app but uninstalled it. Why? Cos the rolling drop down selection just takes too much time to select as it keeps rolling instead of stopping. Should just give option to key in the info instead.
3,"One of the best fasting apps I've ever tried, but also too much ads whenever i press anywhere an ad got to pop up which is very annoying, I hope they improve this"
3,"I just downloaded the app this week, but started my intermittent fasting last week. I have no idea how to enter my last week fastinf time. Help please. Thank you."
3,"App is great. However, I've been using this app for 4 months now, but all my tracked data suddenly disappeared yesterday for no reason at all."
3,"The app itself is ok, but it has forced ads.... Ugh. I like that it connects to Google health, but having to watch ads is not worth it to me. Uninstalled."
3,I bought a new phone and none of my fasting data transferred. There is no link to contact. You can send suggestions but no way to ask a question.
3,"Liking the app but i can not seem to find a place to modify my payment, cancel my subscription, or get contact info. This is concerning to me."
3,Doesn't save edits to fasting end time. Can't work with that. Not everyone watches their phone every second of the day. Rest seems okay.
3,I really like this app except I paid for a 6 month plan and all that does is remove the ads?! Is there something I'm missing? What are the benefits of paying a subscription?
3,Decent app. I dont like that under recent fasting the fasting times are incorrect... even if I've done a 20 hour fast it only shows 13 ect.
3,I have a problem that i can't change the end time of fasting once I start a plan. The only reason I keep this app is the fasting level.
3,No fasting widget BUT developer seems to care about improving the app and the layout is very aesthetically pleasing overall.
3,"I liked it, but there are now a whole lot more ads, had to stop using it. Edit: I get it, but maybe the ads can beat bar at the bottom?"
3,My wife is not paying for the premium service and has a water tracker plus widget and I am paying for premium service and I do not have this feature. Not sure why?
3,"I used to love this app, and I still do, but the long unskippable ad every time I open the app is too annoying."
3,"I completed a 16 hour fast today, but it didn't register....Please fix this! It was the longest fast I ever completed, yet it didn't ""count"" so frustrating -_-"
3,"Just starting this, I have always been thin sometimes too thin. After years of trying to regulate my weight I did it and have been on the high side of a normal BMI for almost 8 yrs. Ate whatever I wanted. THEN quarantine ( lock down hit) sat in house ate and ate and ate an incredible amount of food. After 10 months I have gained 7 lbs by doing this and now am in overweight category. I do not exercise naturally energetic but that has been limited. So I want to lose what I have gained plus some"
3,I was loving this app on my old phone. Now on android 11 and can no longer see the weekly fasting schedule which was really helpful. The app seems to be hiding from me when my fasting begins and ends?
3,"No way to edit the weekly fasting plan so that: 1) a day has 24h fasting, 2) a day has more than 2 intervals. The default plans do have those kinds of timings."
3,Was great until the bombarded of advertising. A few here and there but too much is a call for me to delete and go to another. Was nice while it lasted.
3,It shows different achieved fasting times for a single day in different reportings. I've sent 2 emails already to ask about it and never got a reply.
3,The app is great the reason for 3 stars is that I loss my data one week into fasting...I have to start over die to phone crashing.
3,"It's alright ig. The ads are kinda mean though, I hit the start fasting button and it showed a Door Dash ad."
3,"Could be really good, but it is non stop ads. There are much better choices available. Sorry, uninstalling."
3,"I've selected ml instead of fl oz to track my water intake, and lbs instead of kg to track my weight. For some reason, it keeps switching me back multiple times a day. ‚òπÔ∏è Please help!"
3,"Can change the time like clock... Eat time simple meal suggestions pls. Cuz I feel pay for nothing and my friends say just using alarm phone better then this app..and  for refund.  System info(App v1.0.6A5, Model ELE-L29, OS v10, Screen 1080x2139, en _ , GMT+08:00) Also... Please do some to your notification."
3,"Lagged my phone a lot. Random ads were kinda annoying too. If you have a subscription service, then why do you need ads on top of that?"
3,"The app is reliable and fairly easy to use, but the amount and disruptiveness of ads is just a tad bit much."
3,"It's actually a good fasting app, but I find the notifications and badges annoying. I wanted something more simple, and this app wasn't for me."
3,"I liked it at first but when I was starting to adjust my eating time so that I could be flexible with it, it wouldn't adjust the way I want it to."
3,"Not sure. I paid the subscription, but I haven't lost any weight. I've had better free apps and I can't figure out how to get a refund."
3,Not everyone take 3meals per day. The application gives fixed number of meals. I think it would be best if you could set the numver of meals you take
3,I like your app so far but there is a small problem with it. Those that follow a ketogenic lifestyle remain in a ketosis state. We don't have glycogen stores to burn through after each meal because we eat very little carbs so when we begin fasting after our last meal our body does not have to burn through glycogen stored up to begin fat burning. Our body burns up the food we've eaten then goes right back into fat burning. The timeliness you give don't reflect that. Keto adjustment options?
3,"i started using this app 2 days ago and its kinda good, but now the app getting slow, i already tried to uninstall and install it again but nothing changed, its still slow, can you fix it? its a good app tbh"
3,"Nice graphs, but the more relevant functions besides a dumb timer are all hiden behind subscriptions. No, than you."
3,Difficult to set start/stopped times after a few hours. Forget to update & struggle with settings.
3,i have joined this app and have set up the timers to notify me the start and finish of fasting but i get no notification also can this be connected to fitbit .
3,Hi this is a good app but it automaticly took 20.99 from my account last week .i understand how to stop this happening next year but i have NOT recieved the premium yet .i would like a refund of my 20.99 please ..
3,"Its almost perfect, besides from it lacks of alarm, like for example, if user has done her fasting he/she should have received a notification that her fasting is done. right?"
3,"I paid for the full year, but last week when in the app it says I don't have the premium anymore. I liked the app which is why I paid for the full year. Please help"
3,"Good app, but too many ads. Also what's the point having continuous Zomato and swiggy (food delivery ads for People outside india) ads in a fasting app üòÜ"
3,Is it a good app meh It's a timer that cost money for tips why do that when you could just use paper to write start and finish times And Google tips on what to eat and not eat when fasting
3,New notification design is questionable at best. I enjoyed the old colourful display in the notifications.
3,"I no longer use the app hence would like to cancel my subscription. I can not find where exactly to cancel, please help."
3,Works great until I forget to log my fasting end time . . App won't allow you to enter an earlier time if for example you forgot to end fasting until an hour after breakfast
3,The app was great but now you can't change the time as easily on a daily basis if your window varies.
3,I like it as it is informative but as a tracking app it is very basic. Like a timer really.
3,A nice clean app... However the programs do not allow you to track your actual fast start and finish...
3,The app itself is fine... But there are waaaaaaay too many advertisements for stupid apps and video games that you have to sit through... I mean waaaaaaay to many.
3,"Some Ads are fine. Too many ads is terrible. This has too many ads AND in app reminders to pay. The app, minus the ads, is 5 star."
3,Way too much stuff blocked by a paywall. Not exactly useful if it's so narrowed down to basically a demo.
3,Too many Ads! This app was perfect until I clicked the update. How do you get rid of the Ads. Is there a restore?
3,"Overall, it's a good app but quite scummy to have a 2 week timer set before you get bombarded with ads."
3,This app is good but it needs the ability to pull in weight tracking from other sources like the WiFi/Bluetooth scales or Google Fit or MyFitnessPal...
3,"nice app, wanted to purchase premium on sale but i get an error that Google play is not up to date (even though it is and i purchased another subscription an hour ago)"
3,Unable to update fasting end to reflect *today*). Have had no issues prior. I hear it has been updated. How do I update my version?
3,"There's about 40+ types of fasting plans, but I can't see them. I'm looking for daily plans, but it's very limited. Please help."
3,"Reinstalled to clear data? First install app had comprehensive information about fasting/ketosis effect on body hour by hour but it's disappeared now? Also NO body status screen there,its shown on installation info but missing from app?"
3,"I like it, just wish I could change the notification so it's counting down how much I have left vs how long I've been fasting."
3,Too many ads. App is okay but sending that many ads is not okay for what the app brings to me. Not impressed.
3,"I only wish if We can change the ending time of the fasting period, because sometimes I forget to stop the app before eating."
3,Ok seems good so far. When I end or start my fast early or late it's very difficult to adjust and leave future schedule back on track.
3,"Its ok, but I have to keep correcting the start and stop fasting times, wish it would just keep my settings until I changed them."
3,The app does not have background process. It shuts down after cleaning some memory or restarting device.
3,My only complaint is the app takes time to load upon launching it. Plus I wish it would alarm once you complete your daily goal
3,Nice overall easy to use..just a little hard when you're not subscribed to their subscription.
3,Won't use so middle road I won't use because using a gimped app because I don't have the subscription f that you really need to have a trial period don't care how cheap it is trial period required
3,I quite liked the app but found it quite expensive. Can you tell me how to cancel my subscription as I can't see where to cancel the app? Thx
3,"Nice UI, but doesn't show remaining time, percentage ..., graph with recent fasting splits a fasting to multiple day's"
3,"Useful app, but since month change I can't edit my end fast time to earlier today. The first option is yesterday or dates in March"
3,I believe the articles shoulnt be locked behond a payway and could be unlocked if the user achieved enough goals in this app. Otherwise its only a 3 star for me.
3,I like fasting because it is easier. Like cutting drinking to certain times a day but don't know if fasting led to me getting sick.
3,- Annoying ads when trying to just start the app - Which you have to do because the notification disappears for some reason at random points
3,"Pretty good, but sometimes I get stressed out with the fasting for some reason :( other than that, you guys are awesome !!"
3,"Don't see why u need to pay for an app to tell u how to fast n what to eat when it's common sense anyways,I'll use without paying n see how I get on may add more ‚òÜ's if its better than I think,mayb I should of read reviews lol, seems to be many negative 2‚òÜ's n under, never mind, only thing it was gud for was the timmer for how long I fast n how long I was allowed to eat,i said if I find it any better I'll add ‚òÜ's, so to my word I will add 1 for what I just said about timmer, upto 3 ‚òÜ's, lol"
3,"It will be nice that if we start to share your app, you will avoid to charge us the money to become premium. That's it. Thanks"
3,I did not even use this app. I did not realize there was a charge to check it out/test this app. Please reimburse me the fee asap. Thank you!
3,"I paid for premium, don't see a big difference, it keeps switching to some weird mods I didn't enter."
3,Seems like the free version is just a timer and not much more. Too many ads.
3,"Its okay but it needs more information on the other methods of fasting like alternate day fasting, it mostly focuses on intermittent fasting"
3,So far I really like the app. Unfortunately I keep getting an error message when trying to connect to Google Fit.
3,So far so good. Patiently waiting to track my results after a month
3,The obnoxious ads when you first open the app are enough to make me want to uninstall. I used to really like this app.
3,I thought this app will give you notifs about fasting and rehydration time but its not. You need to update it manually everytime!
3,Has no option to export import data. I don't want to sign up for this just to have my data persistent.
3,"I like this app, with its timer and goal weight chart. However I wish there was a way to ask questions or join a community."
3,"I don't mind ads, but the auto play videos that you can't stop for the first few secs are a bit naughty"
3,"Pity when you're a member you cannot start your plans whenever you want, apart from on time. I never had received adds probably connected to your social media sites and as I've never been on them"
3,"Ok, but I would like to be able to change the preset amounts of water, and if I have to change something from the previous day, I would like to be able to do it."
3,"I just install and buy the premium, i wonder what the diiferent . My premium dont give me any advantage. I hope to get tips daily or weekly like other fastic aplication"
3,"used it a few days. Good fasting features, google fit sync but subscription too high"
3,"I love the app, But is there a way to back up data to restore later when I change my phone? Or is that in premium package?"
3,"This used to be an awesome app, now the ads are more hindering and making it almost not worth using anymore."
3,"Solid app, but.... It's great overall but I deleted the app then couldn't load my profile back once I reinstalled it."
3,"Not user friendly, confusing and limited options for recording data."
3,"Was a good app, now just loaded with ads"
3,I used to love it but now the adds are so predatory it's really brought the experience down. I would give 5/5 a few patches ago now only 3/5
3,I wish i could add history. I have been fasting for 16 hours each day for a few weeks and just finished a 46 hour fast. I would like to be able to see that accomplishment.
3,Good but please add vegetarian option.
3,"They are good they are great but when they are not, they really sucks."
3,"I fast 24hrs once a week. No support for that in here. Also, sources for your health claims would be more persuasive"
3,I bin fasting sins I was 8 it's my familie's tradition to fast wen your pretty big so for dose who's are doing dis for the first time believe me wen I say at first its gonna by hard but the more you do it you can see it's not dat hard so don't quit please take my word for it üëå
3,Custom area ... won't let me change anything. I want to do 40 hours
3,Nice app
3,"ok,"
3,"ok,"
3,"Love this app overall, but I feel it can use some improvments like account syncing. I would love if the app synced across all my devices so I can keep track of my status."
3,i really wanted to get fit so i downloaded some apps this was one of the i have only had it for 3 days and it was my first time fasting. I forgot what i was doing so i started to eat. i rememberd after i ate i was suposed to be fasting. so i clicked stop fasting and put when i stopped eating i went back and it didnt stop it i tried to put it in a few nore times it dosent work.
3,Starting in times keep changing and Icon for app disappears after one day
3,"One of the best fasting apps I've ever tried, but also too much ads whenever i press anywhere an ad got to pop up which is very annoying, I hope they improve this"
3,"I just downloaded the app this week, but started my intermittent fasting last week. I have no idea how to enter my last week fastinf time. Help please. Thank you."
3,"App is great. However, I've been using this app for 4 months now, but all my tracked data suddenly disappeared yesterday for no reason at all."
3,"The app itself is ok, but it has forced ads.... Ugh. I like that it connects to Google health, but having to watch ads is not worth it to me. Uninstalled."
3,I bought a new phone and none of my fasting data transferred. There is no link to contact. You can send suggestions but no way to ask a question.
3,"Liking the app but i can not seem to find a place to modify my payment, cancel my subscription, or get contact info. This is concerning to me."
3,Doesn't save edits to fasting end time. Can't work with that. Not everyone watches their phone every second of the day. Rest seems okay.
3,I really like this app except I paid for a 6 month plan and all that does is remove the ads?! Is there something I'm missing? What are the benefits of paying a subscription?
3,Decent app. I dont like that under recent fasting the fasting times are incorrect... even if I've done a 20 hour fast it only shows 13 ect.
3,I have a problem that i can't change the end time of fasting once I start a plan. The only reason I keep this app is the fasting level.

5,"Great app! It tracks your weight loss, reminds you when you have fasted for too long, and it is overall just very good! If you are struggling with your weight, definitely download this!"
5,The best fasting app I have ever used. Easy and very informative.
5,Best app for weight loss
5,"This is the best app I've found to record flexible fasts. You can choose your start time, duration and end time. Very easy to use. You can also record other information like water intake and weight if you want to."
5,Very easy to use. The free trial has been more than enough.
5,"Really good and easy to use, it's helping me understand fasting better and what it does to my body. I've been feeling more energetic and less bloated since I started. Now I get to fast for 20 hours without even flinching. Update: 6 weeks and lost 10 lbs (nearly 5kg)"
5,"VERY HELPFUL! It keeps track of fasting/eating time for you, provides helpful information about what is happening to your body while fasting, reminds you to drink water, and just makes things easier! Very happy I found this!"

5,I love this app! So easy to use and understand. I would like to access more insights though without paying.
5,Really good app for fasting l. Highly recommended üëå
5,Effective cheap option for fasting
4,Think it's one of the best fasting apps it helped a lot while starting now I think it's time to let it go
4,Great app but a bit annoying due to adds. I wish there was a cheaper paid version for those who does need all features.
4,Really nice app it's like a diet manager it records your achievement so you can feel confident this is the best tracker and easy to use
4,Thank you for not forcing me to pay for stuff!! You're really helpful! I've been looking for wellness apps that can help me but not force me to pay a subscription.
4,i wish there was a way for the diet timer to start and stop manually cuz i always stop eating way earlier than the 4 hours and having to do it each time just keeps making me more conscious of eating in general
4,The app is good and easy to use but once you subscribe it is difficult to stop the auto subscription and I am still having challenges stopping it
4,"Great app, easy to use. Ads are fine."
4,"It's pretty straight forward and easy to use, if you are used to fasting it's easy to set on the free mode, but if you are new to fasting you need to pay for premium."
4,"This app is outstanding. They does charge you for anything to use the basics, and I find the premium privileges very easy to live without!"
4,In the water section whenever I enter my personal amount the app keeps changing it back even though I clicked saved to save my personal amount. Would appreciate it if you could fix that ASAP. Overall I've been using the app for 2 days and I feel the difference.
4,Been using for about a week and I've been enjoying it. There are some bugs besides the ads that flash and I've noticed at times it doesn't start my fasting session. So far so good plus I'm using the free version. I enjoy learning about the stages my body is going through.
4,Easy to use. Very informative. Only con it uses the battery a little too much
4,Great app for just plain and easy tracking
4,"Love this app except for how it more often than not doesn't save my time for when i record ""Time to fast ."" Maybe because there isn't a save button like when you break the fast? It's frustrating."
4,Tq for creater this software. though not premium but Verry nice and easy for me. Verry suitable for control sugar in blood and loser weight. For 1 month i lose 5 kg.
4,"Two ads per app launch, once for loading in and another after starting or ending fasting. 15+ seconds sometimes. Edit: I just paid for the permanent removal of ads. Not ideal, but it is what it is. Other than the ads, the app is fine, and does a good job."
4,Good tracker for what it's intended. Way to many ads though. One more TikTok ad isn't going to make me download the app. The tracker also gets confused on start and stop of fasting periods. I often have to put the data in three times as it just won't take the first time.
4,"love this app, but I am sure on my old phone I could customise the drinking trackers volumes!! I can't seem to do that now!!"
4,"It's a very nice app, the only problem is that we can't access many things when we does get premium."
4,"It is very helpful as a reminder to fast and drink water, it is helpful to know in what stage is my body depending on when I started fasting. The weight is not syncing with Google fit and also I would like it syncing with my fitbit."
4,Great app. Motivating bc it tells me when I'm in ketosis. Love the water reminders.
4,Mostly positive. I enjoy the way the app tracks when I can eat and what is going on with my body during my fast. I does like that I can't augment the app during the one day fast. For example I stopped eating by 7:30 pm but the app is keeping track from midnight.
4,"Very nice little app. Keeps you motivated. But it has no any data storage (cloud, data transfer etc). Recently I bought new phone (also Android) and couldn't transfer my data from the old one. All 3-month progress and achievements lost. So I'm giving it 4 stars."
4,"Easy to use, motivating and informative. The free version offers multiple fasting types, with even more options for a subscription fee. That is really the only downside. I'd gladly pay for a full version of the app, but subscribing is a bit much."
4,"This is decent. I like the interface. I does even mind the embedded ads. I am not however, a fan of the full screen interstitial ads, they suck. The UI is nice and clear, I like the notification tray and the overall user experience is good."
5,pretty good

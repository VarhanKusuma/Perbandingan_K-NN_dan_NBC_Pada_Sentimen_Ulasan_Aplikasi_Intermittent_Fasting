5,Chromebook,"This app keeps track of when yofasting and when your not fasting. It also has tips and tells you the symtoms. While you fasting, it shows your progress and shows you when you are starting to lose weight. 10/10. This app is free and i love it! I hope they  make it Withholded in the future! AMAZING app!"
1,Chromebook,This seems to be far too ridgid for practical use. I started fasting at 6:30 pm today but I didn't get to my computer until 7:15 pm. As far as I can tell there's no way to enter the actual time you started fasting again if you don't enter it at that exact moment. No one is actually that dumb are they? poorly off to find a more realististic and flexible tool.
3,Chromebook,"Love this app overall, but I feel it can use some improvments like account syncing. I would love if the app synced across all my devices so I can keep track of my status."
3,Chromebook,i really wanted to get fit so i downloaded some apps this was one of the i have only had it for 3 days and it was my first time fasting. I forgot what i was doing so i started to eat. i rememberd after i ate i was suposed to be fasting. so i clicked stop fasting and put when i stopped eating i went back and it didnt stop it i tried to put it in a few nore times it dosent work.
5,Chromebook,I believe its a good app i will get it on my phone but im giving it a 5 star bc i trust this app also the revs are kinda good but i will get it on my phone tmmrw i rlly hope i become healthy when i go on it!
5,Chromebook,"i really like it! ive just started, but it helped alot on my 26 hour fast."

1,Phone,"Actual fasting history is buried in a sub menu (under the Menu > ""Me"" > ""Timeline"") when it's the main thing I . UI is messy with pictures of people and random links on top of the basic fasting monitorer interface."
1,Phone,"2 years ago this was a terrible app I fasted for over a year 20 hours a day , the app was helpful and easy to use Now, I had to stop using it because of the advertising, this is a fasting app and everytime I open it there is usually a Domino's advertisement or some other food. I understand you need advertisements to make money, but food commercials for people that are fasting? Come.on, who's in charge of this app?"
1,Phone,"Beware: They don't let you hold your  choice for more than a week. You will have to constantly let the app know you  to hold your  every week even though you are not interested in changing it. I get that they  you to engage with the app, but from the POV of the consumer, they are making us work and waste our precious time. They would argue that you can save the  but you still need to take unnecessary actions. I am not willing to hold an app that makes me waste my time."
1,Phone,SKETCHY. Downloaded this app and logged in with my Google account. Suddenly I started receiving sketchy emails and spam text messages. One of the emails stated that my credit card got disconnected from Google Pay. This all happened within 3 hours I've used the app and while having no other activities on my phone since I was working out and working. Can't trust this app.
1,Phone,"Years ago the app was nowhere near as ad infested as now, yet I had no problem buying premium even when I wasn't using premium features. Now it's even hard to navigate the app because ads take half a screen. It seems there was ZERO feature innovation too, so I'm wondering what makes you think it's ok to do that on a TIMER app. I'm not paying for premium in spite of these scummy practices and now this app goes to trash. There are so much better timer apps"
1,Phone,Do not pay for this app. It's not terrible. When I signed up I must've missed the fine print after the you can cancel anytime! line that said I won't receive a refund. That's terrible. It's been a few days. I've never had an app that didn't give a refund.
1,Phone,"End fasting doesn't always work. annoying. I press end fast and confirm Yes. When I come back after eating window, the app is still in fasting and asks me if I  to end fast. monitoring fasting and eating are the only features I need This app is failing with those tasks."
1,Phone,This is the most abnoxious app on my phone. I bought the full version and now it holds trying to upsell me to a subscription. And I fracking hate it! Please add an option in setting to disable subscriptions upsell spam. Every time I see it it makes me hate the app a little more. I definitely cannot recommend the app to anyone and even if I paid for it am actively looking for a better alternative.
1,Phone,"oops, accidentally deleted my review when trying to update it. anyways: it shows too many ads, but i have more issues with this app: it  s you to click End Fast while taking the first bite. let's say youre heating your food for 1:30 minute, so you open the app to end the fasting in one minute. Nope. you cannot end it in this next minute. you HAVE to wait the time to be correct for it to accept. idk man i just  dont like this app lmao"
1,Phone,"I checked recent reviews to see if it was just me and apparently it is but I am constantly having to re-enter the time that I started fasting. I enter it, it starts the timer, everything seems to be working right. Maybe an hour or so later I see that it tells me that I'm still in the eating period. I told you I'm fasting! So I go back in I reenter it rinse repeat over and over"
1,Phone,"Has been fine for a while, but now you have to watch a 20 or 30 second ad every time you open the app. I'm typically only in there for a few seconds to update my timer. Not worth my time. Deleting and finding something else."
1,Phone,"I am being charged a subscription fee for this app. Not only have I not subscribed or consented to this subscription, I didn't even know there was/is a subscription option! And I don't see anywhere in the settings to cancel or even view the subscription."
1,Phone,"I'm fine with ads, but you ap developers need to regulate how ads function. Fullscreen ads with no way of getting out of them or making it extremely difficult to close leading to accidentally opening a website screams scam."
1,Phone,Too many ads that you can't skip (I mean minutes long) to even open the app. Looking for another app.
1,Phone,Be sure to cancel poorly in advance if you don't  to renew! I canceled my subscription a week prior to renewal and was still charged for another year!
1,Phone,Too many ads. Makes you sit through a 1 min ad every time you open the app. Ridiculous.
1,Phone,"BEWARE: The dev does not give notice if you are subscribed and charges you, you will only find out after looking at your bank. no email saying this is about to be charged. no invoices, no communication. It is impossible to get a refund. DO NOT paid TRIAL OR SUB, maybe don' t even download. Don't bother with subscription. I was hoping for meal s but only a hand full of recipes(no ning day by day), the extra information is not worth a sub that and more can be found on YT."
1,Phone,"Don't mind some adds but this is rediculous, makes the app almost unusable and would not consider purchase if this is how they operate. Update: Uninstalled, a short add or 2 is fine, they run 30 second plus adds. Makes app unusable. Avoid this and try something else."
1,Phone,"Ads are too frequent and too long. The photo ads that appear each time you open the app are acceptable, but those video ads where you have to wait five seconds to close them are a true test of patience."
1,Phone,can't get in too many ads that won't go away and if I close the app and open again.... another ad pops up
1,Phone,"Re: in-ter-mit-tent, adj., occurring at irregular intervals; not continuous or steady."
1,Phone,Add pop out every time I open it and try to log. Waiting time to close the app is even longer than the time I log my data. I ended up spending lots of time waiting to close the ads every day. It's very time consuming and annoying.
1,Phone,Incredibly long to boot up and lots of long ads just to pull up fasting timer.
1,Phone,"Using it for 55 days ,off last week it started paidzing, I uninstalled and reinstalled it lost all data despite it syncing,shows no badges, no awards this is frustrating."
1,Phone,"If you  a simple way to monitor a fasting option, this one will nickel and dime you. monitoring 1 meal a day fasting is a paid option, which is absurd."
1,Phone,"Nah fam. With the newest update, I can't set my own eating period unless I go paid. Rather, you purposefully made it more cumbersome to do so as I would need to change it every day? 5 star to 1 star, just like that. I'm uninstalling and finding a better app."
1,Phone,"It's ok to have ads, it's not ok to have LONG ads. More than 30 sec ad just to click a button? What happened to this app...."
1,Phone,"WAY too long to open due to having to watch ads 1st....had it for a long time, switching to something else."
1,Phone,"Even though I bought no ads months ago, they have put ads in every part of this app. It's complete trash now and unusable."
1,Phone,I just paid for premium and still get ads and asking to sign up from premium. I am about to reverse some charges on a card.
1,Phone,"Do not waste your money on premium, it doesn't give you anything extra except no-ads. The app doesn't teach you any techniques, tips, doesn't give any advises, and even if you fast you might gain weight, so it's bullsh*t. I gained 2 kilos since last week just with all this fasting, I guess it's just bad as a timer to hold monitor when you eat and how much water you drink, that's it."
1,Phone,"I opted for a monthly subscription but i searched the whole app and couldn't find where i can cancel the subscription, please let me know. The reason i  to cancel is I would like to see more in the app, especially exercise (workout) reminder through the day, which i expect to be part of the . To have a fixed fasting schedule is not that difficult and i dont think an app is needed."
1,Phone,"Subscription model. No way to pay to permanently remove ads. Instant uninstall. EDIT: my reply to the developer's reply: No, I did not subscribe, and here's why — the only way to remove ads in this app is to subscribe to a monthly fee. Developers are obsessed with this business model, it's profitable for them but a terrible deal for end users. Just make the app available for a one-time fair price. This is a simple app, not a fountain of content. Sub model can't be justified = instant uninstall."
1,Phone,It used to be bad now its not informative and full of ads.
1,Phone,"The app is very bad. But you are forced to watch ads each time you open the app. This is a big nuisance. Earlier, an 'x' sign used to appear after a few seconds, to close the ad. Now the 'x' sign is hidden by a 'skip video' text. But when you click on 'skip video', nothing happens. So you are forced to watch the video. It takes me enormous willpower to fast. By forcing me to watch ads, you are killing my willpower. This is the reason for the 1-star rating."
1,Phone,Not worth the money. Bought the membership and it was a waste. There's no notifications tell you when to stop/start fasting and if you happen to not think to stop the timer it just holds rolling and your records get all messed up and it says you're fasting during the eating period. You can use a timer on your phone and that would be more useful honestly. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Phone,"The ads contains sexual content, I wrote multiple feedbacks no solution. Uninstalling"
1,Phone,Very poor service you guys hold on debiting from my card and that should stop I've cancelled my subscription but still yet debit from my card
1,Phone,Signed up for the monthly subscription. Didn't  find it useful asked to cancel it and 3 months later they're still charging me even though I've messaged and logged out and uninstalled ap. There's no option to cancel subscription on the app itself. And I cant cancel it thru my bank as its not set up as a standing order so bang! It just comes out every month. Shame as other than that it was a bad app.
1,Phone,"SO MANY ADS. I opened the app and was immediately shown an ad before ANYTHING loaded. Hey dev, you ruined your own app with a terrible implementation of ads. I immediately Uninstalled this garbage when I was shown an ad instead of the basic home screen of your junk timer app. There are many fasting timers on the app store that are much better experience with no ads."
1,Phone,"I subscribed to the premium  as trial for month 1, and now there is no option to discontinue it the premium package. Without consent, I was charged the premium amount for next month as poorly. Emailed to the developer several times ('northpark') and till date no response. I am hoping someone can reach out to me before I have to call my bank to block the app's payment. Such a nightmare!"
1,Phone,"There are waaaay too many ads if you don't have a subscription. I mean, like ads and ""get a subscription,"" pop up about every 1-3 seconds. There are possibly fewer ads once you get a subscription, but from reading reviews from subscribed customers, I'm not so sure. This is a hard pass from me."
1,Phone,"not user friendly, only  your money. Can't setup a lasting, custom fasting period. Deletes all your data after you are done. Terrible."
1,Phone,Y the hell so much ads these days.. I have used this app before a year.. and I'm trying to follow IF again.. I'm trying to check State for motivation.. stupid ads are there how many ever time I refresh.. need help or I'm uninstalling ur app
1,Phone,App doesn't always log starts or finished fasts. Gets annoying as it's now 90% of the time.
1,Phone,"The ads recently have gotten much longer when you open the paid app. I like the app, I don't mind watching an ad for the paid version, but the ads are approaching 30 seconds just for me to start the timer. I deleted it and will find another."
1,Phone,Too much advertising. Not usable.
1,Phone,"Awful app experience where the user is constantly bombarded with advertisements and demands to spend money on the app. If the price had been reasonable I probably would have spent some money on it, but the amount they are demanding for an app that amounts to a glorified timer is absolutely insane. I don't know what is wrong with these knuckleheads who are apparently giving praise to this app but this thing is a serious piece of garbage and you should avoid it."
1,Phone,I use like this App and was willing to put up with the ads as they have to make money some how however they have recently added ads for mobile games (the ones that are mass produced and rely on people paying micro transactions to proceed so the worst type) that you can't skip past and that run for a few minutes. This means any usability has been severely tempered as if you  to start or stop a fast you have to wait 2 plus mins. Don't use if you value your time.
1,Phone,"My data is all gone when I reinstalled the app in another phone,8 months data completely gone, so disappointing!!"
1,Phone,Is anyone having trouble setting the fasting beginning to the end? When i do it manually it never allows my  accurate.
1,Phone,"They have the worst photo shopped before and after I have ever seen ?? and it'll say the guy lost 4 lbs and it looks like a 30 lb difference, I don't trust the 4.9 rating now I think they paid."
1,Phone,"Downloaded it looking for an app that will remind me when my 5 hour eating window is up. This app proceeded to bombard me with over a dozen question pages, i had to mash skip. Then there was no way to set a simple timer. Terrible experience for someone already successfully fasting using clocks. Ill find another app or hold using a 5 hour timer on my phone."
1,Phone,"The money for the Premium benefits has been taken from my bank account but the feature remains locked. It has been many hours so far that I have been using the app, but Premium is still locked, and the app doesn't compute the hours that I spent fasting. I have done 3h and a bit yesterday, and than stopped it and changed the , but after finishing the fasting period of the second , the fasting time hasn't added up to the previous 3h. So I have done 13h 30min, but it is still 3h there."
1,Phone,"Horrible app. * App acknowledges my 3 day fast, yet still suggests a meal  * Meal s cannot be customized to exclude foods (I cannot eat eggs, which feature on EVERY single breakfast and up to 6 a day !!!) * ""Advice"" is laughable basic and in parts downright dangerous * once into a  it's virtually impossible to edit times. Never seen a more confusing user interface. Despite having paid for a subscription, I have just deleted my data and will bin the app. bad riddance."
1,Phone,Very annoying ads every time you open the app that lasts for a while !!
1,Phone,if you ever  to close your account it very difficult to close your account. In Google it will only allow you to pause the account. be aware
1,Phone,"Unethical and unfair. Its my first time using this app for a 2 day water fast. And every time I open the app to monitor my progress I am bombarded by fast food ads and Mr delivery pop ups. That is disgusting. How can you allow adverts like that on an app like this? Not only is it discouraging to those who  struggle with fasting but it's highly inappropriate. I get its a paid trial, but this just seems like unusual and crual punishment to potential users for  low blow marketing."
1,Phone,Don't like it anymore. The last update has completely messed up the timeline. I used to use the timeline to check how many hours of fasting I had done every single day as the app would add it up for you as poorly as show you the start time and end time. With the new updates the app is no longer calculating the numbers of hours fasted every day. So now you have to add it up for yourself. Such a shame because this used to be a bad app.
1,Phone,"this new update is terrible, the app was functioning poorly before, but now it collapses every hour or so & the new pictures make it so much harder to tell which state of fasting you're in at a glace. instead of helpful bars or images meant to represent glucose levels, there's all drops of blood. please fix this by bringing the other, helpful images back. in the meantime, i will be looking for a new fast monitorer"
1,Phone,"Major issue with the date and time adjustment. If you forget to end your fast before you eat, bad luck adjusting the time. I literally have to wait until the following day because this buggy app has no recognition of what TODAY means. I constantly fight with the date as it resets my day multiple times to the previous day showing my timer as 0, even though it's negative fasting hours according to the real math. So frustrating to have to manually go in days after. Not worth the hassle. Delete."
1,Phone,"hated this, but now, 6 ads back to back, and I still can't get it open to log. C'mon It opened after 7 ads."
1,Phone,I had installed the paid version n ed to upgrade to the premium version to unlock all features...I did pay for one month subscription yesterday but my  has not been activated and the only difference I can see is that it has become add paid. I sent a feedback yesterday but still the same...there is no way you can contact anyone to help you...no customer service. After receiving a response from d app devloper that specific content has been fed back to my email-I still don' C any changes.
1,Phone,uninstalled. the ads became very annoying unlike before it was bearable and quick.
1,Phone,"I have not been able to enjoy the app yet because I have paid for a monthly subscription for premium and the app continues to treat the app as though I have not paid. This is frustrating, and I have have emailed them to no avail. That is not a bad sign of a functional app. Stay away until they fix. I will update when and If they fix this issue."
1,Phone,"I liked this app enough to pay for the premium edition, but after awhile it stopped allowing correct date input. Effectively, this made the app unusable. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it only to find all data had been deleted and apparently not synced to a server. I'm about to uninstall it for the last time."
1,Phone,"Would gladly give this app a 5 star review.. it's has a beautiful interface with lots of information and is easy to use! I hate it. However I have an issue with the notifications, when connected to my smart watch (Garmin Fenix 5) it send me a near constant notification updating my total fasting time.. usually once every 2-3 seconds which forces me to just completely turn the notification off for the app"
1,Phone,I  ed to like it bc it looks  unfriendly. But it's hard to edit if you forget to log. So hard I haven't figured it out how to do it. I don't always get the notifications reminding me to log which is the reason I left the last fasting app. Everything that you may  to explore cost to view. Maybe a 3 or 7 day trial to see if I even  to even purchase to get the perks... Over all I used it for a few weeks. I dont like it I'm uninstalling
1,Phone,"The app runs continuously in the background even though it still functions fine after I manually close it. I also couldn't find the option for turning off data collection, even though this option was mentioned in the GDRP intro screen. Too many red flags for me so I decided to uninstall."
1,Phone,"The app could be a bit more adaptable. We are all different and have different times, work, sleep, etc. It shouldn't force people to increase the fasting period If they're doing 12 or 18 hours and are happy with it. Also, different bodies take different times to adapt. It should be done  slowly, on your own terms. Don't force yourselves to starve, it's dangerous."
1,Phone,"Th y did not interact with me. But quietly took my money behind the scenes. I have no order. I downloaded the ""paid"" app"
1,Phone,"I subscribed, and I don't see the benefits of paying so much for so little. It's like a clock, that counts down towards your fasting date. Also their daily meals are repeating themselves day after day changing the courses but same food... either 2 eggs in the morning, or 2 eggs in the evening, or 2 eggs for lunch, or chicken at lunch, or chicken at dinner, and always grapefruit. Such dull and non sustainable for any human. I wouldn't recommend this (and thar my 3rd day)."
1,Phone,Used to be very bad before introducing overly invasive and unreasonably frequent advertisements.
1,Phone,"Everytime I jumped to a different screen, an ad popped up. This was irritating and difficult to negotiate thru the app. I understand that this is a way for revenue but I spent more time closing windows than on the app. Sheesh. Going back to Fastic."
1,Phone,"POORLY DESIGNED COPYCAT APP It confuses itself very easily (many examples). Also, won't let the user create a custom fast, even though the option is clearly presented. Dev appears to have merely COPIED another fasting app to tap the trend. (E.g., high-download ""Zero"" app is very similar - and with similar issues.) So yet again, me-too devs are stealing OUR time for THEIR unfairly-gained profits. Tried three days. Frustrations kept building up. Uninstalled."
1,Phone,"I downloaded this to simply monitor fasting hours, which is what the app should do - but they loaded it with constant requests to upgrade to a paid , to the point you cannot open it without the popup coming out. Also, heaven forbid you have notifications on, because it will bing constantly with stupid suggestions you never asked for and basic notion no adult needs to hear. And let's not talk about how it asks you EVERYTHING about you/your body as if it was a medical device. Meh."
1,Phone,"(EDIT 6/26/23): Giving this app 1-star. No real option for fully customized fast. I need the ability to simply start and stop a fast as needed WITHOUT the built-in percentage penalty. Sometimes life events require real time adjustments to fasting schedule. All current options don't allow for complete customization. DEVELOPER RESPONSE was to use ""weekly"" . That isn't completely customizable. A simple ""Begin Fast"" and ""End Fast"" is what I need."
1,Phone,"I received a limited time offer on my phone and tried many times to ""buy now"" but error everytime. I tried to use my Google Play credits and different credit cards but it holds telling me there is an error. Cannot upgrade to the premium version because of this. Very frustrating."
1,Phone,"So far so bad. I like the app, not so crazy about the ads. **UPDATE- Had to delete app, I can't sit through a 30 sec ad to just log in, that's bananas. Who s to watch an ad before they can even get onto app to log info ?????"
1,Phone,"I paid for a 6 month subscription but after a week it reverted back to telling me ""Pay for a subscription"". The ads kept popping up still WTH? Is this a genuine company or a scam? I emailed the company but no reply. There was also no difference between paying for a subscription and paid. Until this is fixed BUYER BEWARE. POSSIBLE SCAM APP."
1,Phone,Just user the timer on your phone. Annoying seeing an ad everytime I wanna just see how long I have left. It'd be better to trigger an ad after I actually tap on something instead of immediately after loading. And idk why anyone would pay a subscription fee for a glorified timer. Uninstalled and despised.
1,Phone,I used the app for paid and was pretty bad. I paid $7 to remove ads and to support developer and now s monthly subscription on top of the money I spent to unlock basic fasts like 20:4. Very big money grab and it's a shame. Just grab Zero now it's on Android too.
1,Phone,"App is a timer. That's it. You're paying for a timer. I liked the feature where it tells you what happens to your body at each stage of the fast (although if you research it looks like some of the info is a little optimistic). BUT... Does not monitor the days properly, listing them as SUN MON FRI SUN MON MON TUES Sent screenshots to the developer TWICE requesting refund. Was told this display is normal. I'm out $17CAD. Buyer beware."
1,Phone,"BEWARE - My partner and I use the paid version, however after converting from iPhone to android she cannot have the premium features she paid for. Several other apps use email and password login allow cross platform accounts including several of her other paid apps, however despite contacting the developers they have refused to assist and quote nonsense about different rules etc. It feels bit of a rip-off and not a terrible way to treat customers. I won't renew and will look for an alternative."
1,Phone,"Too much add , stupid. There are many ways to.put add in non destructive way. Your app is unusable due to excessive adds, whenever you open a single option there is an add, take note you need to watch the full add (2-3 mins) , I am watching a music video?"
1,Phone,reply: As I mentioned before I didn't even have subscription when they cut the payment I ended subscription long time ago and I shouldn't be paying after that it's the system fault not mine ************* I ended the subscription and still payment was cut from my account I don't even have the app on my phone and it's not in my subscriptions on play store
1,Phone,Pretty basic app unless you  to pay $$$ and of course theres ads which are annoying. We always hate having a skip the dish ad pop up in the last couple of hours of fasting. Not.
1,Phone,Not usable on Pixel 6. It is not possible to skip or close any of the ads. Even when they've played the close button does not work. I have to close the whole app and reopen it every time an ad is played.
1,Phone,"Lost all data when my phone had to be reset. I didn't realize I had to sync after I purchased the 1 yr subscription. Very disappointing, glad I took snapshots here and there. 6 mos of hard work lost."
1,Phone,Don't try to close and update app to get features you're missing in the premium services. All data disappeared and can't seem to recover it. Waste of money at this point and first impression of the app after buying premium service for literally no gain.
1,Phone,"It kept resetting what I put in and not saving data. Also had to watch ad videos multiple times every time I opened the app or did anything on it, so annoying. Deleted almost immediately."
1,Phone,"Don't pay for this app. I thought I'd have more flexibility when I subscribed, but honestly, it's harder to adjust and less flexible than the paid version. The notifications don't work. There honestly doesn't seem to be a point to this app at all. Waste of money."
1,Phone,This app dropped all d way to a 1 star simply because I don't know who was stupid enough to update this app so that end fasting time cannot be anything before the current time. What's d point of monitoring fasting if u aint able to put the time u ended fasting simply because u were not able to put it in right away ?????? Whole purpose of the app defeated in 1 stupid update to become almost useless.
1,Phone,"One Simple question : Can I go back in date and key in the hours I fasted ? To hold my records correct ! Example: I downloaded this app today, but I have been fasting since past 7 days but thr is no way you can go back and key in hours for back dates. Sounds like a simple use case to me which has been missed! Sorry but it was going all fine till this situation."
1,Phone,"I like the app a lot. I understand why there are ads with the paid version and normally that's fine with me. Hoever, when the ads run and I can't close the app or switch apps during said ad we have a problem. #uninstall"
1,Phone,"The app is terrible as a concept however it doesn't work. While I have the handy tab telling me at all time if I'm in my fasting or eating period, knowing how much time I have left would be bad, every time I click on it and go to the app it asks me to chose a fasting period and start all over again"
1,Phone,Easy to use Explains benefits at exact times Gives you an easy time frame So far hate this app. Once u subscribe this app does not work at all! Only way to change anything is to delete previous info which defeats the purpose of the app. Very annoying
1,Phone,"I had a terrible review. Then they snuck in annoying ads and hopped on the subscription bandwagon. Let me make a one-time payment to get rid of the ads. If I can't do that, then you won't get my ad revenue either. I recommend everyone else do the same."
1,Phone,"This used to be a terrible app with some occasional and tolerable ads, which is fine, they need to make $$ - I get that. Lately though the ads are like these 2 minute long Gardenscapes ads that last longer than it takes me to use the app. Incredibly annoying"
1,Phone,"Any information this app gives you is paid on the internet. I purchased the premium thinking it will monitor my progress by counting my daily food intake the calories etc, tips on exercising or a list of foods for my body type. You're paying for information you can get on line so I requested a refund. It would be terrible if it monitored your activity, calories and much more"
1,Phone,"The app is unfriendly, however i have an issue as i have paid for a 1year subscription and still getting adverts. This is  annoying and i feel cheated. Can this be sorted please or I get my full refund as i dont see the point of subscription. thanks"
1,Phone,I set the app to monitor my fasting schedule 16:8 but it kept resetting to require me to manually put in my fasting schedule. I had to reset the app 3 times to try to get it to correct to 16:8 with fasting start 8pm but the timer never worked correctly. It's too bad because I hated the app otherwise.
1,Phone,"Update -- Response to company's comment: It is not paid when the majority of the features cannot be used at all. The app's features are totally useless because the ads stop us from figuring out if the app works or not. ORIGINAL: Unhappy. They throw Ads at you in order to force you to pay, before you even know how poorly the app works. The Developers should exercise a little patience with their scheme. I'm removing the app, to try out another one"
1,Phone,Ads are a pain. I  liked this app. Then it started pushing this yahtzee ad. It wont go away till u play. Then it runs a minute ad. I gave in and tried to play to make it go away. It kept making me go to the play store to download. Super annoying.
1,Phone,Trash app. Only bad thing about it is Fasting counter. For paying premium you only get 10 most basic recipes which are Facebook/instagram story style countdown without pause option. Lack of customisability and features. Save yourself some money and avoid paying for this app.
1,Phone,"Very frustrating. I clicked on the button to end fasting but when I finish my eating period it then asks me do I  to end fast, meaning it hasn't recorded my eating period. I then had to manually input the time. Happens every day!!"
1,Phone,"I signed up for a , and don't  like how it's going, tried to cancel the , and there is no where on the site to stop  payments. This wasn't for me. And I hold getting charged. I emailed them with no response. If you are going to sign up, make sure it's for you or you are stuck with payments!"
1,Phone,"How can you try and monetise a system a simple as ""don't eat between x and y"". Come on people fasting is the simplest eating  in existence. You do not need a special app to tell you how long until your next meal... just look at a clock. I hate how they try to charge for the 'advanced' s because there's a massive difference between ""eat in an 8 hour window"" and ""don't eat for 24 hours"" What a joke. Time to develop my own app to remind people when to breathe!"
1,Phone,Poor Support. I purchased the Premuim version but cannot access the features. I ask for help but hold getting the same reply. I have stopped and restarted the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but all nothing. So I have for something that does not work.
1,Phone,"I am unable to change end times of fasting. Then the incessant beeping I couldn't stop. I paid for 6 months, but had to uninstall & reinstall. Then I no longer had the paid . It's a rip-off."
1,Phone,I purchased an annual subscription (it was on-sale) that lasted maybe 2 months. I'm owed another 10 months. There also is no customer support in the app. A feedback option isn't at all the same thing. The app itself is fine for what it is.
1,Phone,Tried this out and immediately uninstalled the app. So many ads popping up. Everytime I open the app it has a pop-up to purchase the paid content and many things were just locked behind a pay wall.
1,Phone,Update...I was advised to sync at which point it wiped all my history. Asked for a refund. Have been refused. Paid for a year and only used 2 weeks so not even partial refund. Don't bother...no better than the paid ones I can't get it to backdate when I started my fast and it won't let me fast for more than 24 hours. I have done two this week's but I has only registered on complete day despite clearly showing two. .Also...it is eating my battery. And they have stopped responding to my emails so it’s pointless telling me to email them again as they have in their response below
1,Phone,Why can't the sound be turned off for ads?! I've looked in settings and can't figure it out. Never had an app like this just open with sound blasting and no option to mute. Definitely not using this anymore if that's the case...
1,Phone,Poorly explained or non-existent instructions. Functionality inadequate. Pointless app. It's easier just to set alarns on your phone to remind you when to start/stop fasting.
1,Phone,I could not enter the times for fasting and stop fasting. When I tried to set the time it kept reversing it so my fasting time was when I was going to be eating. No matter what you do it will not the right start time or end time. In my opinion it's a waste of time. So I am going to get a refund and delete the app.
1,Phone,I am not at all against paying for apps. But in order to shed extra bucks I need to try the product first. There should have been atlest a 2 weeks to 1 month trial period. Also it wasn't mentioned anywhere that it's a paid one. Would have hated to give it a try and then decide
1,Phone,Truly confusing; Fasting hours record split over days; Loses history cos I didn't start a timer each end every time ?????; no ability to go back and add/edit a fast. Ugh. Gave it 2* for the water timer...which was also confusing cos it wasn't clear if quantity had been accepted.
1,Phone,It's a player of unclosable advertisements. Very frustrating when you have to force close an app due to persistent ads. The X button does not function and is for decoration only.
1,Phone,I paid for a monthly subscription and was bumped off of it after 2 weeks. The app goes back into suggesting I go premium. Google still shows that I am still subscribed. Not sure if this is an error or if this is robbery.
1,Phone,"I paid for a premium membership for the year last week, and then the app updated, so now I'm on a basic membership again even though I have paid for the year??? I don't like the premium features anyway but it's not bad that they've been taken away since I've paid for them!!"
1,Phone,"All of a sudden I'm being bombarded by annoying adds. Any action inside the app triggers an add. These are for silly games I have no intention of downloading, what a waste of time. All these adds are  getting on my nerves. Time to uninstall this app."
1,Phone,"Worked fine the first day when I had it set for 16-8, start time of 8pm and an end time of 12pm. The second day I had to change it. Now it doesn't display the correct time. I started yesterday at 7pm and it's currently 8am, which is 13 hours, but the app says 12 hours elapsed time. For 16-8  it says that I start at 7pm and end at 12pm, which is 17 hours. I guess I could use the custom setting, but if the default setting doesn't work, then I don't trust that either."
1,Phone,"This is only a fasting app if you pay a monthly fee, and it is mainly targeted on weight loss, even when if you are not overweight, don't choose weightloss as a motivation and don't enter a target weight, it is till like ""now let's make you loose weight, oh and right, fasting also..but after my personalisation after you filled in all your stuff, there are only 2 types of fasting available for you out of 7 if you dont pay."" And doing the wrong kind of fasting method can be quite negative so.."
1,Phone,Purchased Premium for 12 months and nothing has updated as it's remained on basic . Very disappointed ?? as it looked like a useful app. More fool me for not reading the reviews fully. hold your money and use a diary / calendar to chart your progress instead.
1,Phone,Look unfriendly but water option not available and no option to turn on. Others using this app have the option and they do not have premium. Support has not answered as to why. This appears to be a bug. Will change review when corrected.
1,Phone,Update. It's still awful! The time edit feature is so clumsy to use and the design doesn't allow simple typed input of the time. I'm now looking for a better fasting monitorer. Plenty around.
1,Phone,"Too much adds :( close button do nothing, I press it but nothing happens, so I need to close app and reopen it to be able to use. App is basically just a timer but the splash screen loading time is insainly slow."
1,Phone,"Purchase is too much money. paid version was ok at first, then ads start popping up and have to wait for ad to finsh before using app. Deleted. Using stopwatch built into smartphone. Works as poorly."
2,Phone,"Tricked into paying to remove ads, but the pro functions are still locked and require additional payment (which would likely also have removed ads). The price I paid to remove ads seemed reasonable for a subscription, so I didn't give it a lot of thought since it used to just be one payment to unlock everything. Having to fork over another £20 or so a year just to have the pro features seems very scammy. Not happy."
2,Phone,"The app looks bad and works poorly, but the ads are too numerous and too intrusive. Especially the video ones when you open the app. They aren't skipable, and they seem to cause a delay opening the app (maybe while they load)?"
2,Phone,"Why did I pay for this app, or ly to be directed to another app that does the same thing? And why after paying £30 am I still getting asked to go premium? I  my money back. I'd recommend just picking the hours you  to fast, set an alarm and use your will power to do it. What a waste of money!"
2,Phone,"The ads are way too intrusive. I don't mind ads, that's how you get paid I get it, but when I'm in a hurry and trying to open the app and an ad plays right off the bat, I'm finding another solution"
2,Phone,"Right now there's way too many ads. As an app for fasting it's pretty bad, but the ads are just way too much for me. Unskippable 15-30+ second ads every time you open up the app and sometimes when you press the end/start fasting button. 5 stars without those ad problems. But right now, nah."
2,Phone,"All this is , is a timer and water intake counter. You can do that on your phone. Having said the above, I did use this for about 3 months but I'm deleting it tonight as the ads have become too onerous. Some of the most recent ones, there is no way to shut them down and they just hold going and going. You have to shut the app down and restart it and hope you get one you can exit out of. I got 2 bad ones in a row tonight. 2 the Devs - greed kills. No thanks. I'm done. Deleting. bad bye."
2,Phone,"I've had this app for about 3 years. I used to hate it. But now the ads are absolutely obnoxious, and $4.99 a month is highway robbery for what it does! Please don't get greedy! With 10+ mil subscribers, ???????... I pay WAY LESS than that a year for my food / exercise / macros monitorer that includes a bit of a fasting function. The bad thing is they don't sell your info to 3rd parties, and you can delete your info. I used to think 5 stars for this app."
2,Phone,"So obnoxious. I just needed a simple fasting monitorer (I've been intermittent fasting for years). Instead, I got a busy UI, too many popups, and annoying questionnaire filled with obnoxious messages I don't need. Two stars for not selling my data."
2,Phone,A lot of the options are locked behind a paywall. OMAD is also locked behind a Paywall. They give the option for custom but you can only set a start and have to manually stop the fast. I will be look at other options.
2,Phone,"It's a decent app if you pay for the subscription. Feels like it's made for kids, though, as every day you finish you get a million ""badges"". I just ed a simple fasting timer."
2,Phone,I've been using premium feature (which was quite expensive for no new features added throughout the year) I decided on not renewing premium but paying to remove ads. That was a terrible idea because I mostly do 8-16 s anyway. My issue currently is about notification. The beautiful colorful notification bar is gone in the last Android update. And it doesn't open by itself like it used to when I restart my phone. This is  a user experience bummer. Will update score once resolved.
2,Phone,"Money hungry app. Way too many ads, and takes forever to open. Note for the owners, do you  need to have ads when you have so many subscribers. Make the UI experience the terrible and see what will happen."
2,Phone,"So far so bad. Just downloaded the app and everything is terrible. hate the extra tips and info regarding your body during fasting.... I'll update after a week of use. Updated: It erases the hours of fasting, so if you don't remember at what time you had dinner, the next day you'll have to calculate the time yourself and update the monitor. Its kind of useless for me. Healthy tips aside, the main purpose of the app is to hold monitor for you and it doesn't unless you use one of the s."
2,Phone,"I'm reviewing the paid version. After giving my stats and choosing my , I was expecting a little more interaction from this app. Like recommending how many calories or giving tips or encouragement via notifications throughout the day? Nothing. This is very, very basic. If you  to know what it's doing, you've got to go looking, and it isn't doing much. Stick with paid version."
2,Phone,This app does not gently increase the level of fasting for beginners. There's no proper guidance. So I over did it and came to an abrupt stop in fasting. The overall effect was to gain weight. Also it doesn't warn people with gastritis of its effects and on how to counter the effects of heart burn. The app is beautifully done and its notifications and interface is very bad. The app also does motivation for fasting.
2,Phone,Way too many adds. It's a unfriendly app but if I have to wait 40 seconds and watch an add to see where I'm at in my fast - not worth it.
2,Phone,"Compared to some other subscription based fasting apps, I appecheate how you can just choose to pay to remove ads & subscription is more reasonably priced. Subscription is  over pushed in app tho. Also, there is only a water monitoring widget - fasting based widget would be more useful. Also, the ""creating your personalized "" loading screen is totally faked which is pretty scummy. Honestly, there are lighter apps out there that would better suit the average users needs."
2,Phone,EDIT: Afs have gotten very annoying. Also it seems you can't chabg3e the start and end time any longer. Shame! unfriendly and easy app to use. Adds are not too annoying. And the water drinking reminder is very bad. If there was an option to see the time remaining instead of only the time since we are fasting or eating I would give 5 stars.
2,Phone,It was a terrible app up until a few days ago. Now it's nothing but a bunch of pop up advertisements. Will be deleting this app after I finish my fast. Disappointed
2,Phone,"terrible App, but enough with all the ads! After Every action is an Ad, just plain greed. Very frustrating."
2,Phone,terrible app but I'm trying to cancel my subscription and I'm still getting charged!! I can't find end subscription option in settings please help
2,Phone,"So I got a notification to start fasting, did so without noting the time as I assumed that the app had done this since it had notified me but then the next day found the app had not recorded the start time and I had to manually input the time which I did not know. Would be bad if when the notification pops up app asks you ""have you started fasting?"" and allows you to input time there and then to record it. Thanks for the app, terrible idea and hope this feedback helps!"
2,Phone,"I had to delete the app. After a year or so, I had to endure far too many ads just to monitor my progress. By the time it loaded, I forgot what I was attempting to do! The problem worse as time went on. Now, I'm searching for a new app."
2,Phone,This don't give me any update or notifications when to start or stop eating when I close the app. Therefore it's not  useful
2,Phone,"Used to be bad until now. I have to endure a full minute of advertisement to open the app. Now it is uninstalled, thank you very much."
2,Phone,"It's a unfriendly app, but the pop-up video commercials take too long and is annoying. I understand it's a paid version and hence the advertisements. But, If you're going to include a pop-up ad, doing it to inform by holding the ad simple graphic ad and quick is probably more effective than a longer video ad."
2,Phone,"Ads are excessive, and things it advertises, like the body status are no where to be found."
2,Phone,"I hated the app at first I've been using the custom fast option because I tend to do extended fasts. It worked perfectly at first but now it started to not allow me to end the fast today, it only allows me to end it yesterday so a 20+ hour fast turns into a 1, 2, or 0 hour fast. At first if I could hit save quickly enough it would record it but now immediately it says I started the fast yesterday at 3PM and I ended it yesterday at 1PM. How I can manage a negative 2 hour fast is a mystery!"
2,Phone,"When the fasting  actually works the app is unfriendly but I routinely have problems with it maintaining the proper fasting schedule. I have it set for 14-10 as I am new to the fasting scene. More often than not, however, I look to see where I am in terms of time remaining - be it eating or fasting, and I will see that I have been fasting for 17 hours. There are more shortcomings but Google is capping my character count so I have to end it here. I did subscribe but it definitely is not worth it."
2,Phone,"It's the a terrible app for fasting. Only has 5sec ads so it's alright. Although since the update, the notification alert became boring like the others. Please bring back the old one. It's unique and colorful and it's hard to miss so you will see it first and it will remind you that you're still fasting or need to drink water. I wish I didn't update it. BRING BACK THE RECENT NOTIFICATION ALERT DESIGN."
2,Phone,"bad fasting app... if you're a woman. You can use it if you're a man, but be prepared to be treated like you don't exist or that somehow intermittent fasting isn't for men. All the articles, graphics, guides, ets. only portray women. This is ironic, since intermittent fasting works especially poorly for men, while it can be difficult and problematic for women due to differences in physiology. Why make this such a female-centric app and alienate half of your audience? Dumb."
2,Phone,"This app has huge potential. I have to find anther fasting app because this one gets difficult to edit my start and to fasting times. The process is confusing somewhat. If you skip a day, you can't go back and add you fasting times. It's also confusing to know what day you're setting the dating time. The app will ask if you started dating. When you click yes, you thinking you clicking for the present day. Somehow my fat is showing as if I've been fasting for multiple days. Confusing..."
2,Phone,Overall bad app. I subscribed although fasting just isn't for me and so I tried to contact customer service to cancel my subscription and I can't seem to get in touch with them no matter what I do or who I contact. I haven't been using the app and I'm still being charged $5 a month for nothing.
2,Phone,"Used to think that it was pretty but the excess commercials which caused an extremely long load time finally pegged my BS meter. Was a 5-star hit me. Now more like a 2.5, but since I can't do half points, 2 works for. Would probably be different if I paid for it but sorry. That ship has sailed."
2,Phone,"Had to remove a few stars. Can't get past the ad to get into the fasting app. It's in another language. I have everything set to English, not sure what's going on. Since I can't use the app, it goes from 5 stars down to 2."
2,Phone,"I used this app with a lot of success for about 5 months before it stopped working. The widget now closes intermittently, and the app won't send me notifications for when to start or stop eating. It's a shame because this app  is terrible for monitoring eating/fasting periods. Hopefully it will be fixed in the future!"
2,Phone,"Okay, so, there's absolutely no need at all to get premium. It's a farce. It unlocks 10 mediocre recipes and some extremely shallow ""information"". This information barely scratches the surface. You'll learn nothing. You're better off googling stuff. It's a joke. One star for the fasting timer, at least that works as you'd expect from a timer. Edit: they added some more recipes, in my opinion, that's a step in the right direction. +1 Star"
2,Phone,"I'd give 3.5 to 4 stars, but I'm 5 days in and the app just reset itself. Only change is I paid for no ads. Just 5 days, but that's pretty disappointing. Two days in a row now. I'm about to request a refund on what I've payed as it wasn't doing this for the first few days.  frustrating as, this would be the ideal app for fasting."
2,Phone,Why sometimes do I have to stop the fasting and others it just continues automatically? I have been doing the 16:8 fasting but there has been a couple of time when I realised hours later I was eating bit the app said I was fasting.
2,Phone,I had no problems with the app but after I didn't need it anymore I can't cancel it there's no way for me to cancel my subscription! I can't find no way to cancel my subscription I  need help with this can someone tell me how to go about it so my credit card doesn't hold getting charged! Thank you .... Other than that I truly hated the app and I did lose weight!
2,Phone,"Has a glitch with the notification bar that makes it disappear all the time and also notifications don't get sent, like reminders and such. I've troubleshoot the issue, but I can't fix it. That's such a a pain when you've paid for a whole years subscription. Hate to say I'll be uninstalling."
2,Phone,You have to constantly reset customized s. It's a hassle and  not worth the price.
2,Phone,I hate this app. I wish I had found sooner. Update.. CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS FOR UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES. October 30 My PayPal account was charged over $10 for this app via Click bank and also my Google pay account was charged for an upgrade and has totaled $6.02 I didn't authorize an upgrade. I never give anyone my permission to charge my accounts. I'm attempting to contact someone from this app but all I can find is an email address. I sent an email but would like to speak to someone about this.
2,Phone,"It's terrible for fasting but when I first used it in June 2020, I could monitor my food intake as poorly. That seems to have disappeared with the update and in its place, ads. Way more functional for me through the summer than now. I would hate to be able to calculate my meals again- bring that back."
2,Phone,"I would give it more stars if it let's me add previous fasting times or import data from other fasting app. I was hoping to get out of my old fasting app and use this one, but it seems almost impossible. This app also seems little complicated and lack the integration of physical activity to the daily progress. I would be happy to give five stars if I could at least add my precious records"
2,Phone,"This app has some unfriendly features but overall I'm not loving. I did buy the premium version for one month to try it out and after one day I knew I needed something different. Some graphics aren't very helpful or they're actually inaccurate. In the premium version I'm asked what time I usually eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. After putting the data in I'd expect when I chose a given fasting , say a 20-4 , the app would remind me at my usual lunch time (1:00 p.m.), but it starts at 12:00 and eating time is for 2 hours, not 4. Glad I didn't sign up for the 6 month ."
2,Phone,"Waaaaay too many ads for an app which can count hours. I have a brain and a clock, I can do it myself without having to look at noise between every screen change. Mildly convenient. Adding 500 ads doesn't make me  to buy premium, it makes me  to uninstall the app. bad luck"
2,Phone,"Part of the recommendations in the app is to avoid high intensity exercise while fasting. I disagree with that recommendation. Just the opposite. If you are fasting from 8 or 9pm to 10 or 11AM, a 5am or 6am workout with no food will kick your metabolism into overdrive. Also, you will meet your hydration goals during this time. All difficult... But if you can do it your results will accelerate. Also, this app seems only tailored for women. This is a mistake."
2,Phone,"This app does what it says, there is a timer and other helpful tools to aid you with fasting. But this app also seems to encourage disordered methods, like 3 day fasts, which are dangerous for some people. There is a lot of information that seems to be dressed as positive, such as your immune system being at risk after a 3 day fast, but this app tries to veil this as a bad thing? No. It isn't. This app gives me an icky feeling and there should be more warnings on the health effects too."
2,Phone,"Had for a week or so. Some of the instructions are contradictory. ""You are fasting - start fasting now"". Setting up a week to follow on from the next or just have a rolling program seems to be difficult. There is a countdown clock for the eating period, which makes me  to binge. I think it should be a count up during the eating period. Just not as slick as I'd hoped for a paid app. I didn't realise there was a paid version so feel a bit duped now."
2,Phone,"I've used this app for years and hate it, but recently, ads have been implemented, and despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app, the ads won't close. The ""x"" button doesn't work, and every time you open the app, an ad comes up. I can't even use it anymore."
2,Phone,terrible to start with. It doesn't remember every time I enter for fasting though. I have to hold screen shots of my start and stop times so I can reenter them the next day or week. It can be very frustrating!
2,Phone,"The UI is poorly laid out and slick. However, i think the app does just too little to justify paid subscription. There are just a few recipies included. Basically it just monitors the times when you start/stop eating. Does not monitor food/nutrient intake."
2,Phone,"Only gives me credit for a 24 hour fast when it should be basing it off my last meal and then my first meal which is 31 hours. There is no way to set up a custom ADF . Even putting in my meal times didn't fix it. Im using the Life fasting app now to get accurate numbers. Only thing I do like about this app are the notification bars. But if the info isnt accurate, what's the point? I have now deleted this one. Such a shame since i had paid for the who year and i know I wont get a refund."
2,Phone,Installed app and hated it but recently it started to lock up on countdown for feeding and fasting windows. Also gave me awards for fasting for 100 weeks but I have only been using the app for over 2 weeks. I have just reinstalled the app and may update my review.
2,Phone,App is terrible but I synced my data when I switched phones and none of my badges or accomplishments transferred over. I've tried contacting the app through 4 emails now with no response. They need to figure out a system where at least someone will reply to you.
2,Phone,"I've already changed my subscription to premium for 1 month to try it out, yet there's no any change in the feature of fasting s. I was hoping to be able to access the autophagy s instead of the old ""custom"" feature."
2,Phone,Originally I gave a 4* because my only issue was the s offered but now I don't think I can go higher than 2*. I've attempted to contact several times because it doesn't give me the option to cancel my premium with no answer and now I'm being charged for something I'm not using and don't wish to continue with.
2,Phone,"The app is unfriendly, but I'm not sure premium is worth it since almost all bad recipes use imperial measurements instead of metric. Or there's a combination of the two ""add x milliliters of oil and y oz of chicken"" The app needs an option to display them in your preferred system, otherwise it's pointless and not worth the money."
2,Phone,"I like the fasting level information and what is occuring in the body, but it appears that you  3.99/month for a timer, a water intake monitorer, and some informational tiles. Unless I'm missing something, and I hope that I am, it just doesn't seem worth the cost."
2,Phone,"Too many Ads, before with the paid version I could easily access my water intake, times, etc. Now I have to see ads to proceed to do anything. Some times more than twice at once, it's just annoying. I'm about to delete this app and find another one that does the same without all the ads."
2,Phone,"I think, this app needs lots of improvements. Even though I have subscribed to the premium version of this for an year, it doesn't allow me to unlock various options. My several email requests to change my access previlage are unanswered. I hope they fix these problems soon."
2,Phone,It kept losing my fasting times that I entered. I would have to restart and what a pain that was.  difficult to use. The timer scroll was so sensitive that it would shut if I went past the end even a slight fraction. Gave up and downloaded a different one.
2,Phone,"If I turn alert on it is constantly going off. I would  like to see my progress as I like the icon on top when in use. On custom it does not give me an end time to choose, so not very versatile. Some of the info is bad."
2,Phone,"unfriendly idea, but doesn't function properly. Won't retain my daily data. Won't allow me to edit previous data. Doesn't seem to sync with actual date/calendar. Options for setting/editing start and end times doesn't associate yesterday/today timeline correctly."
2,Phone,"Brilliant UI. But honestly the ads are killing it. The app doesn't push through notifications so i would have to manually open it, what's more annoying is everytime i open and close it i have to watch the ads. unfriendly try forcing me to pay the subscription."
2,Phone,The ads made me delete. I think it's a bad app but the ads have become too aggressive. I can't stand apps that show me an ad when I first open that app. There are plenty of other fasting apps that don't have such aggressive ads.
2,Phone,"If you  to follow a specific  to an exact min than this app is ok. I don't like that I can't edit my start/end time on a  until after I complete the week. So if you don't start the fast at the exact time you have put in your  then your timer is not monitoring properly. You also can't edit anything on prior days, so don't bother monitoring water unless you are diligent about monitoring it the moment you drink it. Don't bother contacting support about anything, they won't respond."
2,Phone,"Notifications don't happen, it seems pointless to have the option for an hour's notice if nothing happens - same on my partners phone. Apart from that the app's decent, but it's a pretty major component that doesn't work so I need to look elsewhere."
2,Phone,"Seems to function poorly. However I think it enforces a very unhealthy attitude towards fasting and health in general. Even though it let's you choose your goals at the start, no matter what you choose, the entire app seems to encourage an obsession with weight loss and burning fat. Sure, fasting can help with that. But there is so much more to health than that, and there is a huge problem with eating disorders and people obsessing over being skinny. That isn't the same as being healthy."
2,Phone,The UI is very confusing. I couldn't find how to create your own fasting . For example 17 - 7. Also the default notification settings are just annoying: way to many notifications that I don't care about.
2,Phone,"Bummer. Went to record 96 oz water intake while away from my phone but it was 1 minute past midnight and it's impossible to go back even 1 minute to an earlier day and edit it. So instead of a bad day drinking water I have a 0 day of drinking water, which is doubly demotivating in that I did poorly but the now has an erroneously logged demerit that it would not allow me to change. Thinking of deleting and just moving to Excel to hold my motivation up."
2,Phone,"I like the app, it's more user friendly than other apps. The issue I have is that the fasting past hours in the user section is wrong. Example fasting for 24hrs but it fills it out as ~21.5hrs. not correct times. Edit: something of recent. An alarming amount of times this app forgets you manually pressed start fasting after eating period. I wake up or go about my day and see that the eating period timer is still on from several hours ago when I am certain I placed the timer to fasting window."
2,Phone,"The application was working perfectly. I especially liked that I constantly had the notification timer to check where I was with my fasting and eating window but after my phone (real me 5 pro) got its latest update a few days ago, I have to manually open the app to know where I am at. It no longer shows me the notification status bar. I am pretty bummed about that. If this doesn't resolve I might have to look for other applications."
2,Phone,"Doesn't ""hold"" entries. About 3-4 times per week I record the end of my fast and it shows me the ""congratulations"" screen and says how many weeks I have fasted. But then when I look later, it has ""lost"" that entry and says that I'm still fasting. Super frustrating to loose that info all the time."
2,Phone,"I like the app, but the biggest issue I have with it is that it seems to glitch and stops app notifications after a while. So it's very easy to forget to start or stop your fast, and completely forget about the app altogether, which is why I would never buy the premium version."
2,Phone,"Graphics are abismal to look at and the notification looks horrible, being just awkwardly shoved into your notification bar. Just stick with the usual notification, don't try to look so different. Other than that, it's fine. monitors time and stuff. Idk"
2,Phone,"I like the functionality of this app however I paid for the premium version for a year, and I only received premium for about a month before it went back to ads. I don't seem to be able to reach anybody at the company to fix this issue!!"
2,Phone,Way too mnay ads that make it not worth wasting my time. Start with next to no ads but after using for a while they show full screen ads that you have to wait for after every action you take in the app. It just a glorified timer. Sorry but this app is too infuriating to use now.
2,Phone,"Liked the app, but the notifications didn't work on my phone. I didn't  the notification banner on, but I ed the pop up notifications to let me know when fasting started and stopped, and they never happened. Bummed because I liked the rest of the app."
2,Phone,"Going to have to find another fasting app. I remember when I would open the app I wasnt greeted by an annoying ad. I can understand an ad after I log something but right to start. No I refuse. I open the app and there's an ad. I Close it immediately. Try again, another add. Yeah I'm done. There's other fasting apps I can use."
2,Phone,Would be a fantastic app if you could properly modify your dates and times. If you go to end a fast later than scheduled and press modify it allowed you to choose yesterday as the date but today doesn't show up. Very frustrating as it makes my fasts inaccurate.
2,Phone,"Too many ads-ads lock up screen. Ads continually pop up to the point that screen is disabled. UPDATE: Thanks for your reply. I have enjoyed the App otherwise, and will definitely give it another chance."
2,Phone,"I'm disappointed to find the Custom  doesn't allow you to set an end time. Update: thanks for the reply. The weekly  is terrible, but it forces 8-day schedules instead of allowing the same schedule to just repeat weekly. I set up a schedule last week and it ended this morning at 12am (even though I intended to hold fasting until 10am) and when trying to start the same  again for the current week, the app has shifted Monday times to Tuesday, Tues to Weds, etc. Now I have to rebuild it."
2,Phone,It looks like it would be a bad if I actually got the features I paid for. I subscribed to the monthly  to try it out and it hasn't unlocked any of the extras that it's says it's suppose to. Pretty disappointing.
2,Phone,"I've done IF off and on for years, but never used an app for the purpose. Downloading this made me realize I don't need an app for IF. I think this is more geared toward beginners who need help. The notifications didn't work and every little thing comes with an ad attached to it."
2,Phone,"At first, I was impressed with this app and paid for the premium service. I now regret doing that. Using the weekly , the app won't let me set my fasting hours from 10:30 pm to anytime the next day. It always puts those hours to the same day and there doesn't seem to be anyway around that. This seriously limits my use of the app, since as a third shifter, I fast at night during my work hours, go to bed in the morning on an empty stomach, and then eat when I get up about 4 or 5 pm the next day."
2,Phone,"No notification when fasting starts or end. Fasting does not end or prompt me to end it even I have selected a 16 - 8 fast. When I hit end fast it does not automatically start my eating period , I have to manually add a new fast that starts in 8 hours. Other than that it's unfriendly."
2,Phone,"I have the paid version. Why am I not getting any reminders or notifications despite the notification settings? The app doesn't guide me through anything if I'm not receiving any notifications. Also, I only see the one-week . Also on the 28 day , I can't customise anything myself except to choose whether I  to skip breakfast or dinner! Just getting the app to work the hours I'd like to fast is impossible."
2,Phone,"Got this and got 1 month subscription but the app is just lacking compared to competitor apps. I can do everything this app has, plus add the foods n drinks I consume n monitor all nutrients and micronutrients on OTHER apps. This just seems like a silly little timer for something you can easily do with any ordinary phone or watch lol"
2,Phone,"I'm only giving 2 stars because I'm not able to upgrade to the 6 month  within the app. I press ""continue"" and nothing happens. I've sent two emails to try and get help with this with no reply I like everything else about the app :)"
2,Phone,"worked terrible the first week, now it shows ""feeding window"" in my notification window when I'm in the middle of a fast. can't get rid of the wrong notification without disabling the notifications all together."
2,Phone,"I enjoyed using this app and holding monitor of my fasts. After weeks of use, it would not open so I had to uninstall and reinstall it and it ended up losing all my progress and past data. So disappointed ??"
2,Phone,"It might be a bad app if you buy premium. I ed to test it out before I actually spent money on it, but there are so many ads I can't navigate the app. What I did manage to explore didn't do much besides try to upsell premium. Personally, this is useless."
2,Phone,"I have made the payment for annual subscription. The amount was debited from my credit card on yesterday. But still the subscription is not active on my app. Please resolve the issue or give any email id of yours, so that i can contact you further."
2,Phone,"So disappointed. I have been using this app for 168 days. I had to change my phone over, and in spite of everything being synced to Google fit, my data will not transfer. So on my new phone I am back to square 1 ."
2,Phone,I liked the information that the app provided. Im new to fasting and reality liked the clock and such. However I have to rechoose my fasting option about every 4 days and reset everything and that's frustrating. It had said feeding window for 3 straight days.
2,Phone,Very focused on weight loss. Does not allow for longer fasts that target longevity/autophagy. The learn section of this app also seems very light compared to others.
2,Phone,"They're only trying to 1.) Get you to upgrade to their premium pay  and 2.) Buy their meals. In fact, many of their tips, which should be paid, are only available if one purchases their meal . EXTREMELY frustrating! They come across as snake oil sales people trying peddling stuff the buyer stuff the consumer doesn't . For that reason, I'm canceling & deletingthis app, and.getting one that's not as pushy and restrictive."
2,Phone,"I expected more assistance in the recipe department. I sent feedback and emailed a number of times. Zero response. Without these guidelines on food, shopping list etc. the app was only helping me monitor my fasting & feeding time which I could do on my own"
2,Phone,"Used to be ok, now there are ads that say shop in English everything else is in an Asian language, not sure which but idk what it says and that's all I can do to get away from the ad. Uninstalled and will find another. I know they all have ads but I rather know what I'm clicking."
2,Phone,Disappointed that there isn't a full 24hr fast option. I  to do my fast tomorrow so maybe it will monitor it for me if I do it all manually but the hours they have as preset options are very limited. My doctor suggests that I start with one 24hr fast a week and work my way to 3-5 day fasts every month to three months. The apps longest preset function is a 20hr fast.
2,Phone,This app crashes my phone. my phone runs too slow and Google maps crashes while giving me navigation. very unfortunate waste of money because I  liked using the app and I'm loving all the information. Had to uninstall !
2,Phone,"Tired of it forgetting. I'm very OCD about entering info in apps like this and randomly, it will forget and tell me that I've been fasting for 2 days. The notification icon randomly disappears too. Potentially a bad app, but I give up."
2,Phone,Ive requested 3 times now to cancel my sub and it holds trying to clear the bank. I like the app only when i  my  to be fasting 7pm til 11 am EVERY DAY....it holds resetting itself. Also i  to change my avatar but no option. Mostly ive fasted for 2 months 16/8 and no weight loss. Please CANCEL! Ty
2,Phone,"This used to be my go-to app for monitoring my fasts, but it's gotten so clunky and in - your-face about upgrading to a pro version that I don't even  to use it any more. The entire app is just one giant ad for their paid service."
2,Phone,"This app doesn't do more than what I can do with notifications/event scheduler in my phone and a Google search for intermittent fasting schedules. unfriendly, but honestly I don't see what value it delivers."
2,Phone,If you do not have access your phone when it is time to start fasting there is no way to set your fasting start time to the true time you started so it skews your fasting time and then it is highly inconvenient to calculate when writing the correct time down on a paper agenda is so much easier. Makes a person reluctant to pay a monthly fee for this when paper is nearly paid these days.
2,Phone,"That app is terrible in the beginning. I paid for premium,although there are no changes with the app. It's the same as if I did not pay for premium. Going to cancel it since it's no different than just using the basic app."
2,Phone,bad app once it was working properly. Randomly one day I stopped getting notifications in when my eating period had ended. I've deleted and redoenloaded the app 5 times now and it still doesn't. All the settings allow notifications. Its very annoying
2,Phone,"I would hate this app more if they allowed you to put an end fast time in for the custom section. You can put a start time but no end time, you only just hit end fast. Frustrating, it's unfriendly to have a count down."
2,Phone,I enjoyed this up and the information it provides along the time I am fasting. The one problem I have is that it holds shifting. I signed up to do a 16:8 from 9am - 5pm and it hold shifting to other times. So I hold meaning to adjust it. Today it gave me a 13 hour eating period. Must be a bug
2,Phone,This app misrepresented what it does. It made it seem like if you got premium you would have a custom fasting  but it just directs you to some generic ones. Very misleading and not worth paying for.
2,Phone,"After using it for over a month, the app is clunky and I continue to have to reinitiate the program I'm using. I'm assuming this has to do with me not purchasing the service, but the lack of consistency doesn't endear me to buy a subscription."
2,Phone,"AND now the weight input is not working. No matter how many times I put it in, the weight won't update. Annoying as it is linked to other apps and my weight won't update for any of it as of two days ago."
2,Phone,It looks unfriendly but when you open the app to input your recent fasting activity it asks are you still fasting? Fasting since when I didn't say I was starting so then I go to try to put in the information and I can never tell where I'm at yesterday? today? It doesn't show you where you're at relative to previous days fasting. You have to go to a whole separate section of the app to find that
2,Phone,"I liked the app, but.... I have a Garmin watch connected to my phone. The constant notification on the phone creates a problem as the notification is constantly showing on your watch. Had to uninstall immediately. Would very much like to try the app with this fixed."
2,Phone,"Overall, this app is so corny. You could barely do anything in there without an ad popping up. They have possible cool features but, you'll never know unless you pay. The only bad thing that i recall is the water reminder. Other than that, not interested."
2,Phone,"Uninstalling. It's ok at what it does, but the ads are getting too long and ridiculously disruptive. Also, would like to see better weight monitoring visuals. Not sure why such a high rating."
2,Phone,"The app is terrible but there are a few glitches. My weight won't update. Also, I have a new phone and all of my fasts and info doesn't transfer over, so I'm basically starting over from scratch."
2,Phone,"The full screen in app ads just killed it for me, I'd buy the app but the only option is a subscription. There are plenty of fasting apps that can achieve the same objective without the hassle."
2,Phone,"It's almost bad, but the monitoring isn't bad enough, notifications aren't loud so they can go completely unoticed, so forgetting to change from fasting to eating period is happening requently, need loud , alarm like notifications"
2,Phone,Not clear cut enough. Using bobyfast app much better direction and user-friendly with no ads even for the paid version!. Monthly it's a little more expensive the this app. But to me it's more worthwhile
2,Phone,"Awesome app until recent update. Used to be able to fexibly record all fasting, recent update made it unnecessarily rigid, you have to pay 100% attention to your phone now instead of just reporting start & finish. Disappointing after getting in to a terrible rhythm with this app, Better than any other until now. Please undo the latest update. Please ???????"
2,Phone,Too cumbersome and limited for what it's intended to do (paid version). Ended up uninstalling and using my stock alarm clock app to set a series of alarms to match exactly what I ed to accomplish.
2,Phone,"bad app, i download 5 different apps to compare. This one, one of the terrible, but ads often covering whohe screen, very frustrating. This wrong way to advertise. I will not use nor buy this app because full screen ads."
2,Phone,"Not bad for clean fasting: encourages use of dirty fast elements. Lots of ads, lots of locked premium content: understandable for devs, but makes this an app you should either fully buy into or not bother with."
2,Phone,"not bad for a paid app! update: december 25,2023 too much ads, like i closed the app midway the ads, relaunched 2x, and it would still play long ads. sorry, i think you guys were terrible at first.. if only positive feedback could pay the bills, huh? AGAIN, TOO MANY ADS"
2,Phone,Two stars because it's easy to use. But don't pay for the subscription. It advertised access to all s but did not get access to all s. Nothing changed except for no ads.
2,Phone,"Like the app, but I had paid for the premium service. I was a week into it and my phone died. I tried to use the app on my new phone but it's not allowing me to use the premium service that I paid for and I have lost all my data. Starting over and may have to pay again if I  the premium service back."
2,Phone,Can you log steps manually with this app? Seems used to be able?
2,Phone,"I have a terrible problem with this app... When I installed it, I initially enjoyed the way it was working and shared the app with many of friends...However on a particular day, I accidentally saved my fasting hours in d mid of day and when I ed to start it again, it automatically starts from the current time, however instead of showing the fasting end time of after 2 hrs, it shows me the fasting end time of the next day...Please help in resetting this for me"
2,Phone,"I did hate this app, but now there's ads unless you pay for the premium. So Uninstalling and moving to a different one. hate this app. Everything is easy to enter and hate the information for each phase of fasting."
2,Phone,"I tried out this application to possibly replace another one I had been using for a while but will go back to my old one. Too many ads, especially in a foreign language, and it takes a long time to open. This application looks unfriendly but the ads aren't worth it."
2,Phone,"Too many ads, they pop up when you're trying to enter information and you can't dismiss them immediately. There are other paid fast monitoring apps that work very poorly and not bloated with aggressive ads."
2,Phone,"It started off on a terrible start. One week in it started to monitor only fasting period, as soon as it was eating time the clock went right back to monitoring fasting period. So now looking for a new app."
2,Phone,"Lots of annoying ads. Can not evaluate what it does, so distracting. bad idea though, with few changes can be a terrible tool."
2,Phone,"Not comparable to FASTIC, which is way better and at a lower cost."
2,Phone,It looked like it was going to be terrible but it's not or I  don't understand it. I set up my 16/8. The 16 ended and then it's like it reset. I hoped it would give me a notice that the fast was beginning but nothing.
2,Phone,A bit confusing on how to get it to work/edit through consecutive days. I thought i had edited it correctly but when i checked back it showed i had fasted 22hrs which wasnt accurate. I have to hold uninstalling and reinstalling.
2,Phone,A scheduling app does not need a recurring subscription charge. They try way too hard to sell a subscription.
2,Phone,"The ads are frustrating and annoying so much that many times I don't register my day in the app because I don't like to be bothered. I tried the premium for a while, but 4 euros per month it's not worth it."
2,Phone,I'm  not getting much out of this app. I paid for the ad paid version and  wish I hadn't now. It has one meal  that I'll never look at especially as I'm vegetarian and there is no option to say I am. I might as poorly just monitor my fasting myself for paid.
2,Phone,"Originally gave this app 5 stars. Started having issues after about 20 days. Couldn't put in time after the fact. If you started a fast but missed input of time, you can't go back and put in the time."
2,Phone,The app is pretty bad. Main problem is the ads. Most ads can be skipped which is fine but sometimes they can't be which is very annoying.
2,Phone,Looks bad... But it's a trap because unless you buy I paid subscription the app is deliberately frustrating in it's lack of customisation. It's a trap. Don't use (unless your fine with subscription).
2,Phone,"The alerts and encouragement messages are unfriendly, but I'm not impressed that you can't choose your own hours for your eating period. And would prefer the counter to count down instead of up. Frustrating, because just days ago I paid for a year. Now I wish I could get a refund."
2,Phone,"unfriendly app but very very aggressive ads policy ! Just removed it and starting using some other more user friendly app with same functionality. It's OK to have ads in paid mode apps, but this WAY above normal ads rate."
2,Phone,"This app was easy enough to use, but I got tired of very quickly. There's too much in here that I think is supposed to be motivational, but it's just poorly-written pseudoscience. I'm not new to IF & I don't need help, but I thought it would be unfriendly to hold monitor. Less than a week and I've had my fill."
2,Phone,"terrible idea deserves 5 stars. But it is an add infested blood sucking corporate app not a healthy app. terrible idea get a sponsor and open all info from the start. Adds are not a problem if it isn't every time I turn a page, but adds and asking for membership money... may your HBO start advertising Tide,Ford,..."
2,Phone,"Ads are in the app are highly user unfriendly. They are ads that make sense, but the ads are blocking users for 30 sec to navigate away, locking the screen"
2,Phone,This could be the terrible application on fasting plus health and fitness issues but the only thing that holds them down it only considers women. You may specify your gender as a man but they hold sending you tips and infos to helps women and not you (the man).
2,Phone,"This app would randomly not save my fasting start or end times. I'd hit save, close out the app, and have to go back in and re save. This happened 3-4 times a week"
2,Phone,"Having problems with tryimg to edit times of fasting. And how am i supposed to get to the higher ""levels"" on the changes going on from fasting if it wont let me go on continuous days."
2,Phone,Impossible to tweak start and end times to reflect actual. No instructions. Disappointed in lack of options when i upgraded to premium.
2,Phone,I hated the paid app and paid for premium to unlock the weekly s but I can't find that option anywhere. When I start a fast it gives me the same 4 fasting options as when it was paid.
2,Phone,"Seems simple enough, but not even being able to save your most basic weekly fast schedule with out getting premium. Total BS. Will be checking other apps"
2,Phone,bad functionality but  needs to educate people about fasting more and the potential complications. I had to stop using the app because fasting gave me severe hypoglycemia. My blood sugar was at 49! It works for most people but definitely should come with warnings.
2,Phone,"It kinda works but too many commercials that continue playing sound even if you close them, I cant edit fasting end time and it's just not clear and intuitive."
2,Phone,Suddenly there are lots of ads without possibility to close [x] every time you  to update your weight or check something. In the beginning there wasnt as much ads.
2,Phone,"It was bad for a while, but they started adding 30 second ads when you start it up. It's a bit much for what is essentially a glorified stopwatch app."
2,Phone,"I upgraded to premium in order to gain access to the additional weekly s like the '5-2' and the 'break for a day' options, but all it did was remove ads. I am disappointed!"
2,Phone,"I can put a timer on my clock app, would be as bad as this app. The topics and answers you can find with a simple YouTube or Google search are somehow premium features and require payment. Do you think I've been living under a rock or something?"
2,Phone,terrible app! Though UI is so clunky. Scaling sometimes ruins the font and buttons specially when ads appear. Will give this a 5 star when UI bugs is fixed. And will definitely subscribe to premium after.
2,Phone,"Too many ads. Go from one menu to another there's an ad. Minimize app, go back and that's another ad. Had it show an ad while editing time"
2,Phone,I can't mark the actual start of my current fast because it's been longer than 2 days since I began. I do 5-day fasts. I am currently on 97 hours of my current 120-hour fast. This app is basically useless if I can't adjust the start and end accordingly.
2,Phone,Having the same issue some others are. I can't edit my end time to a time within the same day. I usually remember like 30m later after I finished eating... Not the next day! Wish they would fix this.
2,Phone,The app is ok but the whole reason I downloaded it was to monitor my fasting with reminders and the reminders to start and stop fasting never work so I always forget to hold monitor of my fasting so the app is pretty much useless to me.
2,Phone,Won't let you pick how long your fast is unless you pay. It gives 2 options and neither are the 20-4. Disappointing as the app seemed very streamlined.
4,Phone,"So far, so good. Will update later. One thing that would be REALLY helpful, is of the little notification icon changed color to res during the fasting window so that you could just tell at a glance if you are fasting or not."
4,Phone,Great app to keep track of intermittent fasting
4,Phone,I have been using it for just over a week. I use the free version and it works well for what I need it for. Tracking fasting hours and weight. One like 30 sec ad when I open sometimes otherwise no Promotions so far.
4,Phone,"So far I really like it! I got the membership. Helps me remember when I'm fasting and keeps track of progression. Let's me know when I hit new goals! However, I cannot find what to do when you need to skip a day or maybe several holiday/vacation days. Otherwise it's great!"
4,Phone,"I like this app very much. It's helpful and easy to use if you are not good at remembering when your start and finish time ( I can't be the only one). The problem I have, is if you have a break then start again. I can't seem to find the old wait loss plan and the progress charts. Hopefully someone can help me retrieve this information."
4,Phone,Great app
4,Phone,"I think this is a great app even without membership, if i would have enough I would subscribe to the membership tbh. However it would be better if we could add our daily exercises, activities or just maybe daily steps so we could see our activity level. (Maybe there is one but i couldn't find it ??)"
4,Phone,I've been using the free version for about a week. So far I'm enjoying it. Seeing the different levels during the fast motivates me to fast a bit longer each time
4,Phone,It's a good app and love app
4,Phone,"I'm just doing the basic free version and it keeps me on track with accountability. Can't ask for more than that, as it helps me form my own habits rather than pushing sole responsibility and necessary reliance on the app itself."
4,Phone,This app helps me stay on track for my eating periods. It also motivates me to eat less.
4,Phone,"I liked the app very much, just one thing needs to change is that we need a option to edit the End time of our fast! Edit: latest version just fixed this issue. Now this app is perfect. I love the interface, specifically the dark mode! The way it displays level and all the information is also very interesting. 100% recommended :) Edit: This app is not giving me any notifications. Usually it use to notify when it's time to end the fast. "
4,Phone,"Free version is best I've seen, great UI and simple intuitive functionality. Only drawback is that custom setting option for fasting cycle does not give the option to set both start and end times. I can't see that the paid for membership version gives you this either. If it did, then this is all the fasting app you'll ever need. Edit: subsequently cancelled my sub. Custom function doest work, no additional features or fasting option s unlocked, and no reply to my email queries. Waste of ££"
4,Phone,"It's a decent app , cheers you up for your achievements and keeps track of your entries, weight and water intake, offers useful information. One thing that helped and motivated me is a little icon at the top of my screen that let's you know the app is tracking your progress. Unfortunately, it would often randomly disappear, confused my brain and I'd forget to enter start and finish time. I wish it would be more consistent especially for beginners as they do better with reminders"
4,Phone,"I like this app. Easy to use and has good notifications and alerts. It goes into ""exceeding"" time, when it should automatically stop and start like other apps do. 10 Nov - response to developer. I've done as you have mentioned but it still just goes into ""exceeding time"" nothing is automatic, no matter what plan I try."
4,Phone,very helpful
4,Phone,"Edit: Devs fixed the membership issue quickly. After trying most of the fasting apps, I chose this for the sticky notification, even if I would like it to be in the standard android style and light. I feel for this to be perfect it would need cloud data saving and body measurements tracking, still I recommend it to all who need to keep things under control at all times."
4,Phone,Think it's one of the best fasting apps it helped a lot while starting now I think it's time to let it go
4,Phone,Really easy. Kinda wish it had an alarm to remind me when to start. It does if I pre program a start time but if I forget entirely it doesn't help. Also wish all reading material was available without having to Withhold for a subscription. I understand having a subscription for programs being personalized but not to access learning materials for beginners.
4,Phone,"I like how this app gives you information about each fasting stage. I prefer not to like that the eating period doesn't have a timer similar to the fasting period. A feature that would be nice to have, is to allow me to decide the time that I would like to eat, and then the app calculates the time I should start fasting (according to my plan 18-6, 16-8, etc)."
4,Phone,"I love this app. It's the reason I keep fasting and I had few cheat days in ~2 months. But it bothers me that my device cannot receive proper notifications (except the water intake one) until I turn the notifications bar on. The notifications bar is too big, the icon stays in the status bar also, it kinda makes the interface busy. Once this is fixed I will be back with the 5*, but overall this is a great app and thank you for doing such a great job!"
4,Phone,"Fantastic app, the only complaint I have is everyday it switches from ml to fl oz on the water counter. End up adding water drunk with the wrong measurement when I click the water notification, switching it back to ml and because the two units not translate accurately, my water counter is off slightly. It's a minor issue though. Otherwise, it's an easy to use, great looking app with plenty of interesting facts and tips about fasting."
4,Phone,"Updated>> Thanks for the response from the dev :) That backup feature will complete this app for sure and I shall look out for it! Original review>> No data backup. This is a great app, nice graphics and features, thanks for the dark mode also! However there seems to be no facility to export data to a file or to Google Drive etc. What happens if we have to reset our phones, or phones get lost? We will lose months and months of data. Hope this will be implemented in a future version thank you."
4,Phone,"It's so easy to use and very customizable and have some sense of achievement rewards that makes me want to continue fasting. I also love that they incorporated the water tracker inside the app as well rather than having a seperate app for it, as a person struggling with drinking alot of water, this is really helpful to me. I'd love to see some daily pop up tips related to fasting. Keep up the good work"
4,Phone,"I have always done IF but this app helps me to keep track of details and helps to remind me to drink; what the difference is between physical hunger vs emotional eating, and helpful hints. I like the recipes too but would like to see more quick and easy vegetarian and vegan recipes in metric measurements too - a big wish list, ?? At these prices a little upgrade would be lovely! There's always room for improvement. :)"
4,Phone,"I love everything about this app except one thing... I can't set up my 72hr fast(for example) with a start and end time visible and counting both up and down with percentage complete/left. That's it... I really need to see both as part of motivation on a long fast. I would up grade, but currently running other apps in tandum now to see if I can have that as well as useful stats and easy interface and reporting provided here."
4,Phone,Great app but a bit annoying due to adds. I wish there was a cheaper paid version for those who not need all features.
4,Phone,Really nice app it's like a diet manager it records your achievement so you can feel confident this is the best tracker and easy to use
4,Phone,Thank you for not forcing me to Withhold for stuff!! You're really helpful! I've been looking for wellness apps that can help me but not force me to Withhold a subscription.
4,Phone,i wish there was a way for the diet timer to start and stop manually cuz i always stop eating way earlier than the 4 hours and having to do it each time just keeps making me more conscious of eating in general
4,Phone,The app is good and easy to use but once you subscribe it is difficult to stop the auto subscription and I am still having challenges stopping it
4,Phone,"Great app, really enjoying the experience so far. I love seeing what state of fasting you are in, although I think it would be a great if it provided a few different facts and benefits (on top of what's available already) of whatever state you are currently in. It would be great if there were extra slots for saving more than one water quantity value and logs of when you last drank too. Other than that, great work guys ????."
4,Phone,"I would have given you a 5 star, but unfortunately I won't because of one feature. Kindly consider making it possible for someone to set a custom ""end time"" for their fasting sessions. Your custom option doesn't allow someone to set a personalized ""end time"". PS: I'm on the free version. That's the only reason I would shift to another fasting app. Otherwise everything else is fine."
4,Phone,"Great app, easy to use. Promotions are fine."
4,Phone,"I've d/l this app a couple of times. Decided to recommit to myself & paid for the year. And I love it so far! The only thing that I can see that it's missing, is some sort of exercise/activity tracker. I'd like to be able to record how much/long/far I've walked/day/week or month for example or punch in how long I strength trained for etc... That'd be great if that could be added at some point. Thank you!"
4,Phone,Love the app and the plans... I've tried a few and this one is definitely the best I've tried. I even paid for the upgrade. 4 stars due to the fact the app will crash and I'll lose my current status i.e. fasting/eating tracking is gone and resets. Also when I add a advanced plan it also just goes away after a bit and I have to add the plan again. Strong Suggestion would be to add a blood glucose/ketone measurement to the app as most people doing this are likely tracking those measurements
4,Phone,I have been using it a long time. Love it. But... the added 'diet plan' option in it is very poor. Eggs n grapefruit etc. Blah! Definitely needs a lot of attention if you want to suggest meals for eating period. I would like to see meal tracker added. Somewhere you can write down what you had during your eating window? And measurements section should have slot for arms measurements as well.
4,Phone,It's a good app
4,Phone,"It's pretty straight forward and easy to use, if you are used to fasting it's easy to set on the free mode, but if you are new to fasting you need to Withhold for membership."
4,Phone,"This app is outstanding. They not charge you for anything to use the basics, and I find the membership privileges very easy to live without!"
4,Phone,Easy to use. Very informative. Only con it uses the battery a little too much
4,Phone,"I like it so far! I've done intermittent fasting on and off for awhile. It's good to give your system a break and give things time to digest, especially if your metabolism has slowed down. This app doesn't give a lot of free options but I like that it tells you what stages of fasting your body should be going through."
4,Phone,"Its very good app, even the free features are very good, few suggestion to make it more efficient. 1. Regular pop up motivational messages during fasting. 2. Please include calorie counter. 3. I have lost all the data of previous one year of fasting when I uninstalled the app for some reason. There was no backup even after loggin in again!"
4,Phone,"I like this app, simple with minimal Promotions. Just right for me a beginner in IF. Also reminds me to drink water based from my chosen time intervals. I do want to propose, in Custom, to be able to set hours, beyond 20 hrs in the fasting. So you can teach yourself and your body to be able to push your Fasting more without having to keep monitoring the clock. Thank you!"
4,Phone,Great app for just plain and easy tracking
4,Phone,Daily plan keeps disappearing. I'm happy with the app and have found the ability to customise the daily plan really useful but unfortunately it disappears now and again and I'm wasting time trying to find it again edit: I need to re-select it. The reminders and updates are great.
4,Phone,"So far I'm really enjoying this app especially the reminders to hydrate. It's been really useful to track how many hours I'm into fasting to keep me focused on my target. The one thing I wish the app had would be to schedule your fast, I normally fast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays doing the 16:8. It would be nice if I could schedule them starting at 8:00 p.m. the night before and ending the following day at noon. But so far it seems like I can only start and end a fast when I'm ready to do so."
4,Phone,"Great app to keep a track on your fasting hours as well as water intake levels. Great job by the team and thanks To be honest and it's my personal opinion that getting the membership content within is a bit pricey as the details like recipies and pro fasting tips are all available for free on platforms like YouTube and a basic Web search, so no point of membership, but ofcourse one could get it to have a hassle free experience and all information at one place rather than doing individual research."
4,Phone,"I would give it 5 stars now that I've paid to lose the Promotions... I just can't because it won't support my window. I'm moving to a 20:4 or 19:5, but apparently to have the app support it I need to Withhold a monthly fee... Not going to happen, I think having a fee is fine for ongoing support and help, but for choosing windows or plans it's a bit over the top. I can stay fasted for my 19 to 20 hours and the app will keep chugging, but I can't set it as an option. Oh well, could be worse I guess..."
4,Phone,"Love this app except for how it more often than not doesn't save my time for when i record ""Time to fast ."" Maybe because there isn't a save button like when you break the fast? It's frustrating."
4,Phone,I like the app so far the fact that most of the things you can adjust per your suitability and also it's keeps you updates on what's going on with your body after every few hours of fasting ...The Promotions are there but you know what it's still worth trying you can always skip the ad it's not like they come after every second
4,Phone,i love this app
4,Phone,Great App so far. I wish it had alerted me that the fast was over so I could start eating. It alerts you to drink water which is nice. I paid for a year. This is the first Fasting app I paid for. It makes me more accountable when you Withhold for something.. I tried the others and the Promotions were killing me. I hope they continue to add on to it. Will give another update later.
4,Phone,Brilliant app. Managed to lose half a stone in under a week following this. Drinking a lot more water 3ltrs per day which has replaced tea. The only criticism is that upon opening the app you instantly get an ad. After every 500ml added to my drink total you get an ad. I suppose that's what you get for choosing the free option. But otherwise I highly recommend this app.
4,Phone,"Really love this app! Helps keep me accountable to the routine, and gives a lot of helpful information. I love that throughout the fasting you can see what stage you are in! Would update to 5 starts if I saw more inclusivity of meal plans for vegetarians and vegans, and also plans for different caloric intake. The suggested meal plan is extremely light and it would be hard to keep full on such a restricted diet. Otherwise really great app and worth the few dollars per month!"
4,Phone,Tq for creater this software. though not membership but Verry nice and easy for me. Verry suitable for control sugar in blood and loser weight. For 1 month i lose 5 kg.
4,Phone,"Will not let me sign in using Google. It doesn't even scroll... *or click on any email to sign in or sign up. All that data lost does not feel good. Edit: I was able to create a new account but months of data and graphs, change in weight, and body measurements are all lost. Still, I do appreciate this app along with Life Fasting. This one isn't as bulky but still helpful and doesn't try to make itself like so many others."
4,Phone,"Two Promotions per app launch, once for loading in and another after starting or ending fasting. 15+ seconds sometimes. Edit: I just paid for the permanent removal of Promotions. Not ideal, but it is what it is. Other than the Promotions, the app is fine, and does a good job."
4,Phone,"Idk why it keeps vibrating. I put my phone in vibrate and it just constant vibration unless I turn notifications off or go silent or ringer. When I has earphones on and ringer on, it was a constant notification bell. Not sure if my phone or app but weird really annoying problem (S10) Otherwise it's a good app and I appreciate the state indicator."
4,Phone,Update: 7/22/20 I wish there was a away to save/link you info with email or FB! My kids accidentally uninstalled the app and none of my previous fasts were saved :( Update: 4/24/20 Thank you for fixing the issue I had with editing the start/stop day! App works great! And is now my favorite fasting app! I like that you can just push a button to start this app and see your fast in the notifications bar!
4,Phone,"Hard to change if you miss a day - I forgot to enter yesterday and it's impossible to find where I can go back and put in that information. Also a bit cluttered with all of the tidbits of information about fasting and happy faces, think I'd rather go back to a more functional straightforward app"
4,Phone,"I have tried lots of fasting apps now and I keep going back to this one. I really like that my fasting time appears in my notifications. It helps me keep motivated. However - I wish it had a 19-5 window and I really wish it had a social component so that I could follow my friends, comment on their fasts, congratulate them on their goals, cheer them on, etc. I would Withhold extra for that feature."
4,Phone,Good tracker for what it's intended. Way to many Promotions though. One more TikTok ad isn't going to make me download the app. The tracker also gets confused on start and stop of fasting periods. I often have to put the data in three times as it just won't take the first time.
4,Phone,"I'm new to fasting and I found it complicated navigating the app to begin with. I like that I can change my fast time once I've finished my meal and am finding 16/8 not too nice as a starting point. You can only try and see how you feel yourself. Also, really reasonable cost in comparison to other fasting apps! ???? out of ????"
4,Phone,"The app is fine and I like the GUI and how each phase is clearly explained. Thanks for including the option to remove the Promotions for a small fee. I prefer not to use apps without this feature. Could have been five star app if you would have a one time Withholdment option for upgrade, except the subscription."
4,Phone,"Favorite app so far but want more details on faces when done fasting, also want to be able to go back and change notes or add to them if I need to. Like today I'm on antibiotics and had to break fasting period twice due to reactive hypoglycemia causing my sugars to drop to the 40's. I want more faces to explain that and a social connect for support when those nice days hit"
4,Phone,"I love the app but I have some suggestions that will really make the app better. For example, there's the widget for water consumption when there should be a fasting widget to easily track as well! My only issue with the app is that it resets itself so the fasting notification often disappears! I went to my notification settings to try and fix it but it didn't solve my issue. But still, great app!"
4,Phone,"love this app, but I am sure on my old phone I could customise the drinking trackers volumes!! I can't seem to do that now!!"
4,Phone,"It's a very nice app, the only problem is that we can't access many things when we not get membership."
4,Phone,"It is very helpful as a reminder to fast and drink water, it is helpful to know in what stage is my body depending on when I started fasting. The weight is not syncing with Google fit and also I would like it syncing with my fitbit."
4,Phone,Great app. Motivating bc it tells me when I'm in ketosis. Love the water reminders.
4,Phone,"$30 to $75 a year seems like a lot of money for what is to its core a glorified timer. I get that you need to make money for providing a service, but this just seems so steep. A one time small Withholdment is really all this app should request and I would gladly Withhold for it. Edit: after a while of using the free version I have changed my review. I still believe that even with a discount, the price is steep, however what you get for the free version is quite good."
4,Phone,good
4,Phone,"So far, so good. I just wish the app would include the estimated total calories of the recipes. Also, the app gives you a “timeline” for when you can possibly reach your goal weight at the beginning, but you can't really find it anywhere on the app after that. I want to know how it came up with that timeline and what my recommended daily calorie intake to reach that goal is. Related, I wish the app stresses more how much calorie intake (deficit) relates to the effectiveness of IF."
4,Phone,"Nice app, visually clean and easy to navigate. Only improvement I would request is that there is a starting date for weight loss so that cumulative loss can be seen from the overview not just loss since last entry. Other than that- great."
4,Phone,"I think the app is good but it would heavily benefit from some calorie tracker... For example, the suggested 5:2 diet is not based on the classic 5:2, which allows for about 600 kcal on the two fasting days, but says you go on a 24h long black fast. Also, the membership plan isn't worth it for those who have dietary restrictions of any sort. There is no way to filter out animal foods, for example."
4,Phone,"My only complaint, and, to me it's a fairly big one, is that if you change plans while you're fasting (deciding to do a longer or shorter fasting plan), you have to end the fast you're on in the app, and when you begin a new one, you can't change the beginning of your fast to before the minute you changed the plan. So, if I'm 12 hours into a fast and want to change to 10 & 2 or 36 hour fasting plan, I can't account for the 12 hours I've already accomplished."
4,Phone,"It COULD tweak a couple of things to make it more versatile and user friendly. And, It IS a bit over the top with the upgrade Promotions but? Considering the price of the upgrade? It's fairly cheap. So, I may try it and see how it is then. Otherwise? It seems like a pretty good app."
4,Phone,"Needs goal options, and to link with apps like Google fit and Mi Fit so you not have to log weight in multiple apps. I do love the permanent fasting notification it adds a good reminder to keep going as sometimes I forget I am meant to be fasting."
4,Phone,"It is good. Would be nice that the custum fasting time could have where you set when to when eating Window and fasting start time together. I prefer not to care for I have to go into the app ,press stop when I start my window. And reset for when I am fasting again. I do 23-1 for my fasting and eating Window. Otherwise I do like this app"
4,Phone,"Good app but it is missing one feature. If you gave 20-4 cycle, it would be nice that you have option once you stop fasting to set 1 hour reminder prior to next fast so anyone who wants to eat for last time that day, they can get reminded by the app to do it so it start fasting immediately..."
4,Phone,"I enjoy this app but I prefer not to like that I can't customize my weekly plans more. I cannot eat past noon about once a week for my religion, but if I choose a weekly plan where I only eat dinner, it won't let me change the one day to breakfast or lunch. If I could do that, I'd give the app 5 stars."
4,Phone,I like the app and purchased one month of membership to avoid Promotions. A few issues... 1. How do you log a skip day? It shows as included in membership. 2. I entered an incorrect weight and cannot edit that days weight. 3. There are lighgenbklts next to the plans and no indication on what that represents.
4,Phone,"It doesn't have the option to do OMAD 23-1, but it has literally everything else. I really wish they updated this. It also doesn't allow for us to create our own schedule and count down from it nicely like with the other programs. So if I select Custom, I can't set an end fasting time. Just a suggestion hope it's added on another update."
4,Phone,Really useful app. I like that it shows the different stages of fasting and the processes occurring in the body. I might be missing something but I would like the option to automatically repeat fasting each day instead of having to input it each day.
4,Phone,"This is a great app. I love that in addition to fasting, I can track water. The only imperfection is that it does not restart automatically if I restart my phone. In addition to the persistent notification (I love that), I would love to see a Widget."
4,Phone,"This app helped me to get into my intermittent fasting journey. Tracking my fasting and eating hours helps me to stay on track. As a shift worker with varying schedule, I cannot use a lot of the apps features, as they are designed for normal, regular schedules."
5,Phone,"Honestly loving this app! I've had it about a week now and still using it consistently. I've noticed a difference pretty immediately. I only have 1 ad when I initially open the app. So I'm pretty confused as to what others are saying about an ad after every click. I am curious about the membership, but so far the free is perfect!"
5,Phone,"I've been using this app for over a year now, and it's the perfect free app for tracking my IF progress. There's a membership option, but I haven't felt compelled to upgrade just yet. The Promotions are minimal, so that isn't an issue for me. I'm able to keep track of my fasting schedule, and I'm able to log my body measurements and weight. Definitely one of my most used apps!"
5,Phone,"DOWNLOAD IT! This fasting app has been amazing! I wanted to keep accountability of my fasting, and this offered just enough from what they offered for free. The ""custom"" cycle was great for when I did my extended fasting. The tidbit info, as far as what your body does after so many hours fasting, was interesting to know as well. Makes me want to try the membership version just to see what other awesome stuff they have behind the Withhold wall. Seriously considering it and I prefer not to EVER do that!"
5,Phone,The Fasting - IF app is a really good tool. Currently using it for the first time. I like that it is very good on the info intake for your profile and uses it to build a program to work with you . As a non subscription user this has great features before you upgrade. The ability to know what is going on with your body during the fasting stages are solid facts and very useful. You are able to create and customize a schedule to the regiment of your choice. It can be synced with Google Fit
5,Phone,"Great fasting app and I haven't experienced any glitch. Love the nuggets of information when you reach a milestone of fasting and it's helped me go longer on my fast when I see that I'm in fat burning mode, or ketosis or that my body is beginning autophagy state. (12 hours, 24, 48, etc.) I've purchased the app, cost like $20 for the year and I can't tell the difference from free version to subscription. I'm happy to support developers,but if I can get the same features for free..."
5,Phone,I have always had an issue with my weight and have tried countless diets always failing in the end. I would lose weight but always seemed to put it back on time and time again. I heard about intermittent fasting and researched it very intensely so I looked for an aide to help me achieve my goal. Then I found the Fasting app and I couldn't be happier. I gave it a try and was so impressed that I got the membership package. It offers me everything I need and I am showing so much improvement. Get it.
5,Phone,"The free version of this app is all I need, but it has more stuff if you want to Withhold. It doesn't bombard me with ""helpful advice"", which is why I uninstalled the last fasting helper I tried. I prefer not to have to log every single thing I eat--I just have to stick to the timing plan and drink plenty of water. After only a few days, I'm already waking up feeling better."
5,Phone,"When I first tried fasting I used an app that I was over Withholding for by a lot, this free option is basically exactly what I had with the addition to do a custom fast which is really nice. Super useful tool for someone who needs that stimulation that tells you you're doing a good job. Nothing like looking at the clock after a fast and feeling great about yourself."
5,Phone,"The best fasting app, ever. I'm not even kidding. This app lets you count your water intake, calories and has exercise plans, in addition to fasting. It doesn't even cost much, for all the tracking and work that the app does. No complaints, whatsoever. 10 out of 10, because 5 stars isn't enough!!"
5,Phone,"It's my first time fasting, and it's only been a week and I'm already seeing results. While I have been working on changing my eating habits, I find that fasting has helped me change the way I eat even more (in a positive way). The app itself works nicely and Promotions aren't obstructive or annoying. I love the little achievements since it encourages me to focus on my goals and strive further each time. Overall, highly recommended."
5,Phone,"Free version is good, but I paid for the membership and am not disappointed. It's inexpensive & has a simple user interface. I didn't want anything too complicated and this is perfect. I like how you can adjust your start and end times if you forgot to set them right away. I'm fairly new with the app, so if I have anything more, I'll come back & update my review."
5,Phone,"Easy to understand app. Great companion to my weight loss journey. I had been using another app, but it was $30.99 a month. I found this one to be astonishingly well priced for all of its features! In fact, I spent less than half of the previous month's cost of my other app for the entire YEAR! I hope it goes well for the rest of the time, but so far, so good."
5,Phone,"Has been an exceptional fasting app so far! Easy interface to work with. Very simple! Love the water tracking, weight tracking, and body measurements tracking features. I love the fasting timer, which is always running in the background. This is what is keeping me on track!"
5,Phone,"I love this app. It has all Kong's of articles that explain everything you could want to know about IF. You can change the time to record when you last ate, to track when your fast starts and stops. I have tried IF before with no success because I would just keep eating/snacking. This motivates me, and I have not cheated since I started tracking myself with the app."
5,Phone,"I haven't had it for very long, but the experience so far has been great. It has no age limits, and it does have a subscription but it's fairly cheap (10$ monthly). Not only can you track fasting and the app will tell you when you can stop for optimal fat burn, but it also gives you tons of recipes, insights, and advice."
5,Phone,"Loved the app for the most part. Simple, easy to use, and kept me motivated. My main reason to get this app was to examine if IF would make any difference for me. I used the app to keep track and was able to fast 20+ hours for 6 consecutive weeks. Unfortunately it made no difference in my weight, looks, other measurements, or mental clarity (on low carb during feeding times). Not a fault of the app ??, but I did delete it since I am no longer motivated to use it."
5,Phone,"Ok I love this app..have lost 35 lbs since I started using it. Intuitive GUI, very configurable. I have just one issue..I recently updated to pro and under the section that lists pro features it shows that you should be able to skip a day somehow except I can't find it anywhere..today is Christmas...I wanted to skip fasting for today but...can't find whatever it is that is supposed to allow for it."
5,Phone,"I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says Withhold 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any Promotions, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would Withhold for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job."
5,Phone,"It's an easy app. to use, I have the free version, which comes with Promotions but you get what you Withhold or not Withhold for. The Promotions are less than a minute, easy to exist and I get the basics of what I want, to track my water and fasting time so I know exactly when to break my fast or start. Every day is different, especially with work, the app. does the time for me. Can't ask for more, it's exactly what I wanted but it has more features if you're looking for more, it may cost you and that's normal."
5,Phone,"I like this app because it has the persistent notification that tells me how long I've been fasting, as well as tells me [an estimation] of what's going on in my body. It really encourages me to push just a little longer and hold out! I like that it's not overly bulky, doesn't have a ton of confusing features; it does what it's meant to do and it's aesthetically pleasing. One thing I would like to see is an optional water reminder, and another nice thing would be weekly/monthly progress."
5,Phone,"Ok I love this app..have lost 35 lbs since I started using it. Intuitive GUI, very configurable. I have just one issue..I recently updated to pro and under the section that lists pro features it shows that you should be able to skip a day somehow except I can't find it anywhere..today is Christmas...I wanted to skip fasting for today but...can't find whatever it is that is supposed to allow for it."
5,Phone,"I've been using this for 3 weeks now without membership and do like the options of various intermittent fasting including a customizable option. Its simple and it reminds me to drink water, and you can see how long you've been fasting without entering into the app (as long as you not block the notifications). On a more personal note, I've been using the 20:4 ratio (20 hrs not eating and 4 hrs eating) to which I only have 1 meal aka portioned and healthy lunch. I lost about 3 to 5lbs."
5,Phone,"I've been using this app for 41 days straight and I love it! The notifications are just enough without being too much, the informational messages about fasting stages and tips are great, the devs are constantly pushing out new features (addition of water tracking is awesome! I've been tracking in the Samsung app and using two apps is a hassle). I definitely not need more things standing between me and being successful with fasting, and this app makes it very simple to stay on track. Thank you!"
5,Phone,"Really nice app design and pleasing interface. Promotions are not too overwhelming even though I'd prefer no user interruption. Would love to see a changing widget in the status bar (the icon next to the clock on the top left side of the screen) but it's unfortunately static so you have to open the app to check the progress. Also, in the main page, having countdown to mealtime is more important to me than how long I've been fasting. Maybe have an option to toggle between the two. Thanks!"
5,Phone,"Very easy to use app. Has lots of cool features. I bought the membership plan cause it's cheap, has a little more fasting plans, and Def not like Promotions. But, if you go the free route, this app is still great to use. Had no issues or crashes, and the fasting times and dates are highly customizable. It even syncs with Google fit of you want. What I really like it the levels of fasting it shows you're at. Kinda reminds me of a game, where it's you versus the clock to get to the next level."
5,Phone,"Just started yesterday. It's not a life changing app., but it's persistently in my face about my timeline and offers more options if you want to upgrade. I'll give it some time, possibly upgrade. The app is nice in the way it gets you to think about what and when you're eating. I might try the water reminder in a couple days. Not a ton of info in free mode and Promotions as usual with free apps. Ultimately it's your choice but nice motivation if you have a reminder and tracking."
5,Phone,"Thumbs up. Upgraded immediately since I knew Promotions would deter me. No regrets. Still testing various plans, but very happy with this app so far and recommend to others. Feedback for improvement: (1) a widget option that shows eating/fasting timer with fasting state, and (2) add an ""insight"" that describes the process of autophagy and its benefits/risks."
5,Phone,"Great for my needs, which is a custom fasting plan, meaning that I prefer not to have to choose specific windows for eating and fasting on the daily. Most helpful to me is the activity levels based upon hours fasting, which explains what's going on in my body; it really encourages me to push harder to get to a higher level of healing. It's not all about weight loss. Easy to access link on notification bar let's me see how many hours I've either fasted or have been in my eating window. I recommend!"
5,Phone,"I NEVER rate apps... But, for this one I'll break my rule. Just started using it and it's awesome. It's like having a buddy to help you stay encouraged and hitting your goals. The tips are useful, the interface is easy to use, and the tracking features help keep you motivated because you see results over time. I paid for the year and that's the best way to go in my opinion. I'd have spent at least that much on one good meal so why not for a year of ad free support? And paid really is ad free!"
5,Phone,"42 days in and I couldn't imagine being without it. After a very brief learning curve, it's been very user friendly and intuitive to navigate. I've found that with using MyFitnessPal to help manage meal plans, I now have a winning combination. 16-8 seems to be the plan that works for me, but the app is flexible enough that the it often turns into 18 hour daily fasts, with occasional 40 hour stretches. The meal suggestions are worthless, but the water tracker is outstanding."
5,Phone,Great app that is simple to track intermittent fasting. I wanted something simple that just tracked my times of fasting. I like that it has limited choices and doesn't alarm constantly trying to track other things. They offer a more in-depth plan and fasting options but I do not feel that I need those resources. I like that it has those options for individuals that are new to fasting. There reference to where you are in the fast allows beginners a better understanding. Overall good app!
5,Phone,"This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with."
5,Phone,"UPDATE: 9 days in and have officially lost 10 pounds. It wasn't perfect, so I probably could have lost more BUT relearning how and when to eat is a process. The process is made WAY easier with this app. Try it. If you fail, KEEP trying until it sticks. You got this! ********* So far, so good. Just started two days ago. Testing out the free version. I'll circle back in 4 weeks and update progress and see if I want to upgrade."
5,Phone,"Love this App. Free version is great. I prefer not to mind the Promotions, they are not bothersome. Recording and editing your fasting times is easy. Editing is needed if you know when to start eating and you forget to record it. It keeps me on track. Also the gentle water drinking reminders are very helpful. Since I work at a desk all day, I have to be reminded to keep drinking. So happy. If I prefer not to like an app, it will be deleted after a few days. Great job! Weight loss is easy with this."
5,Phone,"I've tried several other IF apps, but this one actually does exactly what I want. In my phone notifications, I can easily see if I'm fasting or eating and how much time is left. It also gives reminders to drink water. There is some customization available (times, reminder frequency, etc.). It's got an easy interface. Overall, I highly recommend."
5,Phone,"I have tried all of the top fasting apps on the Play Store and this is by far the best! I love the pinned notification and how easy it is to modify the start/end time of a fast. Some features that I'd love to have would be a visual widget for the fast (like the tracker shown on the Fasting page), along with a visual time tracker in the pinned notification. Being able to visualize how long you have left in the fast without having to check the app would be awesome. Thanks for reading!"
5,Phone,"not miss out! Great app to keep you on schedule for intermittent fasting or any fasting you want (with the paid version). In free version, Promotions are minimal and can be closed after 5 seconds. Lots of recommendations, helpful tips, explanations what your body goes through. I've been on it for 1 week and I feel less bloated than I have the last 3 years. Thank you!!!"
5,Phone,"Very intuitive interface that guides you through the fasting process while providing enough options to be flexible but not overwhelming. The insights are plentiful, informative, and well written. I'd suggest they add more meals to the diet plan. Only having two breakfast options is a placeholder, not usable content. Overall very happy with the app and my fasting results."
5,Phone,"Final ingredient I needed. It was confusing for me at sign up to see that this is a free app with all the initial membership plans flashing. Bypass those and jump to the free aspects which have been enough for me. Able to keep an eye on the time without fretting every other hour. My hunger is curbed by being able to focus on life and drinking more water, the clock lets me know when to stop the fast. Simple. Options for beginner and levels above."
5,Phone,"The app definitely keeps me on track. I like reading the description of the various stages I'm in while fasting. I haven't found the Promotions to be very intrusive at all. However, as others have said, for some reason I can't modify a custom fasting time to an earlier time today, only yesterday or earlier, which causes me to lose records of my fasts. Hope this bug gets fixed soon! **Update - they fixed this bug so I'm changing my review to 5 stars!"
5,Phone,"Does the job. Tracks fasting, weight, and provides useful information. Perfect! I have been trying to lose weight for the last 3 years and I'd lose and regain, never getting to my ideal weight. Using this app to track my intermittent fasting, I've finally lost those last 11 pounds. I'm thrilled!! Clothes fit again! Favorite features? The fasting timer both till fasting starts and till fasting ends. I would Withhold a one time app fee, but not a subscription for membership. Wish they would change that."
5,Phone,"This app is simply amazing! It really keeps up my motivation and helps track everything important. I love how it's customizable to your own choices to help you ease in. I've already lost 10 pounds using this app! It does take time and a lot of effort but this app really gives you all the information that you need and more. You can track more than your weight but also do measurements, track water intake, and even shows your BMI score. Love it"
5,Phone,The app is simple to use and gives info about each fasting stage so the user can understand what is happening to the body at different times during the process. At a glance the app shows what percentage of fasting is being completed for the day. And I like the reward plaques that mark progress when goals are completed. I am so happy that I found this app for tracking my interval fasting schedule. The app has never crashed and it works well on my Android.
5,Phone,I have lost weight and i just feel better eating less often. The app is informative and encouraging. Understanding what's happening is helpful and I prefer not to have to worry I forgot when the fast ends. It stops my evening snacking. *The developers are very responsive and helpful. I do wish there was a log in of some sort. I am on my third phone and I have to start over and lose stats and records every time. I can't even transfer phone to phone.
5,Phone,"Great App; Great Tool I'm not a fasting kind of guy. Mainly it was due to not knowing much about it, and the benefits from it. Making something new like this a habit of difficult. This app tracks your fasting schedule, no matter how beginner or advanced. Plus, it tells you what your body is going through hour by hour which helps keep your will from unwavering, for me at least. I highly recommend to anyone starting a fasting schedule!"
5,Phone,"i think the app is pretty good. the features are simple, but i think that's a good thing, considering its primary goal. you can set custom fasting timers, change the time you started and ended if you forgot to end your fast before eating. it has some helpful tips, you can track your water. i think this app serves as a great supplement to apps like my fitness pal and bublup."
5,Phone,"The app works well from a technical standpoint, has a nice and clean design, gives easy to follow instructions, and most importantly (in my opinion) is a shining model of what the free version of a paid app should look like. The Promotions are present but not exhausting and constant, and while Withholding for membership would certainly unlock some nice functions within the app, the free version is more than usable. It's a good balance; one that feels respectful to users."
5,Phone,"Tracks my fast in a simple, straight forward way. I like the learning aspect of what happens to my body during my fast. It's easy to choose which fast to start, when the feeding window occurs, plus the edit option is a nice feature too. I've had no problems with this app which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in intermittent fasting (IF)."
5,Phone,"It's very simple. You input your info and decide which plan you want. It then warns you an hour before your fast startsand an hour before it ends. When you are fasting it tells you what stage you are in, which is nice, but the info never changes. It tracks your lifetime fasting time, has a weekly tracker showing how much you've fasted. Very simple, but nice. No annoying Promotions or push to buy or upgrade. Attractive app and easy to navigate."
5,Phone,"Very useful and understandable. It does have Promotions, but they are not that frequent. The app has a lot of interesting topics, knowledge and tips for free. I like the fact that if you missed to clock in or out of the fasting period, you can go back and change it. I also like the water reminder: you can use it in oz. (I understand oz better), you can schedule the reminder for every certain minutes to hours."
5,Phone,"This is the best fasting app I've tried so far. It has enough good features, but not overloaded like some are My only complaint is that I found it virtually impossible to use the free version. I could not do a thing with it without being constantly nagged to buy the pro version, which was disappointing and very annoying. But fortunately, the price was reasonable compared to some others. Regardless I rate it 5 stars because it's easy to use once you get past that. Helps a lot with IF!"
5,Phone,"I love this app. However, I have only used it for about 2 weeks now and twice it has reset me back to my first day of fasting. It still shows all the days I fasted but it says I'm on day one again. This is a little frustrating when you're trying to look at your overall achievement. Mentally I know how hard I've been working but it's still nice to see. The app is very helpful in keeping me on track. Just wish it wouldn't keep restarting my progress. *Update* Issue fixed!"
5,Phone,"This app is working great for me so far. I really like the interface and the reminders. It is really helping me keep track of when I can eat next. Before finding this app, I lost track of when I had last eaten surprisingly easy. It's also great having a visual reminder of how long I have remaining in a fast. The coolest feature is the display of what stage of fasting you're currently in and what's happening in your body during those hours. Super motivating!"
5,Phone,"My favorite fasting app so far, after trying three or four others. The free version has great features and the Promotions are not in-your-face. I think an option to record body fat percentage would be nice for those of us who might consider that data useful. Better still would be if you could sync body fat percentage data with Google Fit. Overall, however, I am enjoying using the app and seeing my stats over time. It really helps keep me motivated to lose the weight I've gained over the years."
5,Phone,"I really like being able to refer to the tracker throughout my fast. It helps me stay motivated to hit and surpass my daily goal. It helps you keep track of daily and weekly progress, and gives little tips about what your body is going through during the different phases of your fasting time. I've staying on my planned schedule for the last several days since downloading and have referred back to the app dozens of times each day."
5,Phone,"So far so good. The app is very easy to use, and I really like how during fasting it keeps you motivated by telling you what your body is doing during each time period. The free app is awesome and you won't feel like you're missing too much without Withholding. I have yet to see an ad.. I plan on Withholding for a plan not because it is needed (you can absolutely do this with the free app) but I will enjoy what you get with the plan. It will give you a more advanced plan and tell you a lot more. 5 ?'s!"
5,Phone,"Best fasting app I have tried. I love the ""fasting stage"" info status notification on my phone ...as keeps you motivated. Everything is very cleanly organized and simple to use. The only wish I have is it would let you customize a weekly fasting plan from scratch. I do 2x36 hour fasts with 1x24 hour per week. This doesn't match any of their pre designed weekly plans....so I have to just use a custom fast each day....versus being able to plan it ahead in the app. Otherwise, best app!"
5,Phone,"This app has honestly helped me with fasting. Having the banner turned on gives me motivation each time I look at my phone and the BEST is seeing what state my body is in and what it means. When it's almost my old eating time, I look at the app, become proud of myself, and just keep hanging on until I am actually ready to eat. Best lifestyle change!!"
5,Phone,"I've only had it for a day, but so far so good! I have the free version and while the app makes clear the benefits of having the Withhold version, the free version is still fully functional and ideal for anyone new to fasting. The app itself is pretty intuitive, and I say that as someone who doesn't use a lot of fitness apps and trackers. Plus the Promotions aren't obtrusive, which is a pleasant surprise!"
5,Phone,I am using this app for last 10 months and it's best fasting tracking app. The new custom fasting feature is amazing and it gives more control. The Promotions are reasonable and they do not show in the middle of the activity so it is okay. Adding a gadget to show fasting would be amazing. Similar to water tracking gadget. I would Withhold for this.
5,Phone,"Easy to use, love the reminders, over all my favorite fasting tracker and I've tried many! I'm losing weight just following the 16/8 plan, but I have used custom (still free) to achieve autophagy. I love that at any time you can see what effect fasting is having on your body, the app gives you info based on how long you've been fasting. Can track weight, water, and there are lots of tips and tricks."
5,Phone,"So so helpful, I honestly can't find a thing to complain about the free version. It's simple and easy to track your fasting/water intake/weight plus it offers valuable info and insights during your fast. I've found that even the notifications telling me what my body is doing are enough encouragement to keep me on track when I get discouraged. The Promotions are short and non invasive. I am considering Withholding for membership since it's inexpensive and I'd love to support the developers. 5 ? s!!"
5,Phone,"Unbelievable and amazing experience. From the get go a brise. For me the Intermittent plan 10-14is perfect. Thank goodness I fond this app. Realizing that I need to loose weight (not excessive that is) will lift my mental health as well. Swimming and daily chores was not enough to maintain a healthy weight. The plan is and was sooooo easy,thanks to all who are involved in creating this app. Change is one installment away. Highly recommend Martin"
5,Phone,"I suck at working out and not eating completely healthy. With my anxiety and depression and adhd, intermittent fasting seems to be the best option for me. I'm over a week in and the water reminders help me always get more water than I did before, and to see a timer telling me when my fast is about up and when I can eat, and can change my fasting plan, it truly has been a really good app. Not a sponsor for it, but I did Withhold for membership services to also help push me to stay on track."
5,Phone,"This app is great! I'm a more advanced intermittent faster & this app helped me lose 10 pounds in 12 days! I went from 135 to 125. I'm 5'3"". I will reach my goal soon! I just would like to be able to edit in my fasting timeline because if I forget to check easy instead of just right or forget to record weight, it will not let me go back to change it. I will however be going membership on this fasting app because I want to use the automatic settings for autophagy. I really like this app.Thank you.?"
5,Phone,"So far I love it more the app ""simple""for fasting. Here's why: This app is easier, and I love that I can back log or front log my fasting starts and finishes. I always messed that up and forgot to log fasting and end fasting at the exact times. That's important for me. And I really like the toolbar reminders and notifications feature for starting and stopping fasting, and the ""levels"" of fasting benefits info. Impressed so far. Good price as well. Sarah"
5,Phone,I love this app! I haven't been able to lose weight recently with my regular cutting back on calories and I have tried a couple of other programs. This app motivates with a timer and it tells you what phase you are in. It has tips and much more. It even checked in with me when I had been fasting for longer than usual. I am losing weight and feeling great! I really did not think this app would make much difference for me but it definitely has! I am using the free version.
5,Phone,I love this app. It's informative when you're nervous about what to expect from the plan and has good water reminders. Id prefer a one time Withholdment for no Promotions but I'd say as of right now the Promotions aren't annoying. Update: I do wish there were data backed sources to be better informed and explain accurately to my concerned friends and family.
5,Phone,"I've used other fasting apps. But like this one best so far. Feature I liked most is its just a basic start and stop, but you choose how long you want to fast. While you fast it tells you whats happening in your body during certain time periods. Very cool, and it notifies you to drink water, how much longer you have etc. Also can track weight and goals as well."
5,Phone,"Several family and friends already used this for 2 years and suggested it. I thought nah and can handle fasting on my own. I did, but it was not as easy. I bought this app and I rarely buy apps. I love tips, recipes, encouragement, and more that is included. I have been an intermittent faster over 2 years, but this in just 48+ hours has transformed the lifestyle I chose for health and longevity. Thank God for this app. The science behind it is deep and this makes it easier."
5,Phone,This app has been wonderful with helping me track my fasting and water intake. Being able to alter notifications and fasting times is great. The Promotions are annoying BUT they are way less than I've had on here before. Custom fasting is what I use because I can adjust to the time when I started if I forgot to start my timer right away. I'm not understanding people complaining about Withholding for this when removing Promotions is 3$. 10000% happy with the free version and the weight tracker is a lovely bonus
5,Phone,"This app has really let me see if I'm being successful with my intermittent fasting and takes all the guess out. So even if I have a snack after when I should, the app will let me know when I can eat the next day if I keep to my (insert amount of hours fasting). It also has some cool bits of info that are nice. I use the free version and still enjoy it :)"
5,Phone,"It's easy to use, and I like that I can customize or go past my time if I'm feeling good. It also lets me keep a log of all the different experiences with the individual fasts so I can monitor if something is off. Really nice interface, and other than the Promotions (which I could Withhold to remove, in all fairness), it's been great so far."
5,Phone,FINALLY someone makes a great fasting app. I can already tell is great. So many free amazing touches Ill probably go membership after I try it for a month. Ill update soon! Update...I bought the monthly subscription. After 2 days ??. So worth it guys and a very fair price compared to most health apps. Absolutely loving this app. Just finished my first fast (48 hours) and feel amazing. The tracking makes the motivation better and I know it will encourage me to make it a healthy lifestyle change.
5,Phone,"Really awesome! I've been using it for 4 days so far, & it's a very well-rounded app. It regularly reminds me to drink water (which I do anyway, but its nice to track the exact ounces) and I love how it breaks down what your bodys doing at different points in your fast - for me thats really encouraging to keep going & keep my eye on the prize. The only slight hiccup is when I tried to change my fast start/stop time, it was confusing on how to get that adjusted simply, but that could just be me."
5,Phone,"Motivational! It's easier to feel confident with fasting with the information and tracking you get from this app. The reminders to drink water can get annoying, but I find them effective as well. When I get hungry, I re-look at the stages of fasting, drink some water, and power on!"
5,Phone,"this app is incredible! its very easy to navigate, it has nice graphics and pictures for the reminders, and its educational!! it was so nice to read what happens to my body in every stage, and it inspires me to reach my goals. i highly reccomend, especially for beginners!!"
5,Phone,"Love this app... Yes you can count your fasting hours on a regular clock/watch, but why not have an app that can help. You can select a weekly plan or you can start your fasting whenever you want. Keeps track and if i forget to eat (which sometimes i do) it tells you how and what your body is doing during your fast. Which is cool! Thank you guys for this informative and user friendly app!"
5,Phone,"This app is fantastic and is just what I was looking for. I'm new to fasting really needed something to help keep me on track. It gives you the typical fasts (i.e. 16-8, 18-6, 20-4) along with a custom option. It also gives you an idea of what's going on in your body during each stage of your fast which also helps keep me going. A timer will also show up in your notification bar as well. It also provides a water tracker if you need to keep track of that. Lastly, the adds are not intrusive."
5,Phone,"This App tops the pack, with a wealth of features and an intelligently designed user ui. Leap Fitness' IF Tracker is a trully fantastic and capable Application for the serious health conscious advocate of all fasting models, intermittent fasting included, of course. It is seemingly crash-proof, educative, very responsive and fluid to user commands and I count myself fortunate for having chosen it in the first place. Kudos to the developers !"
5,Phone,"I love this app, I do wish it had a way to filter out certain foods because for meals it always suggests eggs almost everyday, but I am allergic to eggs, so I can't really make use of this feature. It's a shame, it seems really good as food is the thing I struggle the most with. It might be a hard feature to implement, but I feel like people would appreciate it. If it's already in, then I can't find it."
5,Phone,"Helps to keep you accountable and game-ifies maintaining a narrow window of food consumption throughout the days you choose to fast. A big caveat is that you can undermine good results by giving in too much to your hunger during the window of time you allow yourself to take in calories. Still experimenting with it and have mostly used it in ""strict"" mode with two hours or less of eating time during each day."
5,Phone,"Way better than I expected and Promotions aren't excessive or anything. Even without membership features the app offers a lot and make it very easy to lose and track your weight, stay hydrated, and stay active when needed. Also has many rewards you can get that encourage you to reach your goal. Also the custom feature is amazing when you're trying to fast for multiple days. Also gives many tips in a sideshow like format. Keeps any age interested in wanting to know more and be healthier. One of my fav apps"
5,Phone,"Currently my favorite fasting app, mainly because I love the ongoing notification that tells me what state my body is in. Knowing I'm in ketosis is extra motivation not to eat until my fast period is over. The interface is clean and easy to use, and Google Fit sync is nice if it works(?). It hasn't synced my weight yet but I just started using it. I do wish there was a way to track water intake within the app. That would make it worth buying pro version for me."
5,Phone,"Extremely Helpful Fasting App. I have been using this Intermittent Fasting app for almost a year now and I have to say it has really changed my life. I not only feel better physically but also mentally and emotionally. My hormones are in check, my digestive track is working better, my skin looks, and feels amazing. I have lost most of the bulge from my stomach and my clothes fit much better. If you are on the fence about purchasing this app, not be! The price is budget friendly. Just do it!"
5,Phone,"I was using another fasting app but it didn't even notify me when I was supposed to finish fasting. In comparison, this one is so overwhelmingly useful & interactive it's even kind of fun? It makes it feel like a competition. This app is definitely making me enjoy fasting a lot more. If I have any complaints, it's that it might be draining my battery a bit faster than usual, but there's most likely already a function to remove the timer from the notification bar."
5,Phone,"Very useful app! Helps me track my IF and measure my water intake each day. Encourages me through the various stages of fasting. My goal is to reach autophagy once a week and I love when my app shows me in that stage (goal achieved!) I have water intake reminders through app as well, so another goal achieved. Btw, I use the free features and it works well for me."
5,Phone,"I've been using this tracker for a very short while but I can already tell that it's going to be the key to my success with fasting/keto dieting and ultimately sticking with any sort of plan or schedule with eating clean and losing weight, period. I have never had any luck in the past with such things but I'm confident with the help from this one particular super resourceful app this time I am going to be! It's so helpful. If you're considering fasting and need support download THIS app now!"
5,Phone,I am in LOVE with this app! It is so easy to use. By far my favorite feature is having the bar at the top of my phone screen reminding me how much time I have left in my fasting period. I also like that it let's me know what happens during that time- knowing I am in the ketosis fat burning stage is so motivating to keep going! The water reminders are great and it's honestly just cute to see the little whales ?? float to the top of the screen and tell you all the benefits of water intake!
5,Phone,"Pretty chill first week, I like that you can fix it if you forget to start eating/fasting. Sets a needed schedule that's east to follow. I'm only at 14f/10e, but its a breeze so far. Even with the adds, which are minimal, the app is very straight forward, user friendly, great navigation.. just all around a well created app without any extra unnecessary flash"
5,Phone,"What's great about this app is its simplicity. It's a fasting app period, end of story and it doesn't clutter itself trying to be anything else. You came here to track your fasting and that's what you'll get-- fine tuned to your chosen schedule. You also won't have to go anywhere else to learn the basic ins and outs of intermittent fasting."
5,Phone,"I was fasting before using this app, but it makes it easier. I make a custom schedule as I fast longer than any of it's suggested programs. It actually reminds me when I normally start fasting in the day... telling me my fasting should be starting soon. It's smart and learns quickly. The only thing I'd like is a food schedule that doesn't include grapefruit, I'm not the biggest fan ??."
5,Phone,This is easier to apply and the app is not as intense and overwhelming as others are. I like that there's a water monitor included. I also like that you can customize your plan. It probably won't be exact but it's very close to my work schedule. I prefer not to like Promotions shown in any app but it is what it is. If it becomes too annoying then I'm out.
5,Phone,This app goes in-depth and allows you to see what is going on with your body and gives you pointers on how to get the best experience - even without upgrading to the membership status. Highly recommend! I have exceeded my health expectations for reaching my goal already in the first week. I have always had trouble losing weight doing diets/exercise - but using the 20/4 plan I lose about 2lbs or more per day!!
5,Phone,"So far the app works great! No bugs or glitches. I'm not a ""dieter"" but need to lose 20-25lbs for health reasons. (I have arthritis-extra lbs exacerbates the pain- n extra weight made my blood pressure raise. My Doc wanted me to take medication. I said, ""No Doc. I'll do it holistically n change some lifestyle choices. Intermittent fasting is working for me! The app helps me stay on track with a variety of reminders and offers healthy eating advice to help reach my health goals. Its a success!"
5,Phone,"The app interface is easy to use on a daily basis. Simple. There are help, info, and advise flash cards that you can access. They are very informative. The emotional eating tips are especially helpful for me. There is even a status icon that lets you keep track of what state your body's metabolism is running. Very helpful. You can easily edit the start or end times of your fast. Keeping track of your weight is easy and well displayed. You can also track your chest, hips, and thigh measurements."
5,Phone,"Edit: I figured out the water tracker... Go into the water settings by clicking the bell and then clicking on the option and it'll allow for readjusting. Adjusted to 5 stars because the water was my biggest issue. Great besides Promotions. Promotions occur and it's perfectly fine, but when I trying to add water and one plays, or when I'm trying to mark time for start/end fasting it's kind of annoying, but no biggy. Just because I track everything while at work also."
5,Phone,"Been good to me! I have 1 million things going on in a day and this app keeps me on track. I love the updates on which phase I am during the IF cycle, the water reminders, and I appreciate the milestone rewards. It's motivating. One thing is constant in my world, I lose and gain weight! Coming back to this app always gets me back on track to my goal. I love it so much I went membership to enjoy all the features!"
5,Phone,"This app, the paid version, is great! The recipes for your eating periods are absolutely smashing! The simplicity and user-ability is fantastic. The aesthetics are wonderful, and the information provided is excellent. I think the app would be the greatest if they were able to incorporate a general formula that allows you to add calories and foods for eating periods where you can remain in ketosis. Other than that, this app is worth the 20 bucks for the year!(on Google play)"
5,Phone,"Programs are super easy to follow along with, and even easier to stick to. There are multiple monthly subscription options that are very fairly priced compared with similar apps and programs. If intermittent fasting is what you're looking for, I would DEFINITELY recommend this app, especially for beginners!"
5,Phone,"(membership User) Absolutely what I needed to keep myself on track during a fast. The interface is easy to use and the tips on fasting are helpful and appreciated. I love the options for different fasting plans, as well as being able to easily keep track of my water intake. I could go on, but you should experience this yourself. If you're on the fence give it a try and you'll see results if you follow the plan and advice."
5,Phone,So far everything about the app is running great The countdown clock makes it easy to see how long I've been fasting and how long till my fast is done. Also there is a way to set it so I get reminders to drink. I like all the little tips about fasting and the stages of fasting that are there. I did Withhold the $20 to get rid of Promotions not sure how much it changed but not regretting my decision.
5,Phone,"I LOVE this app! I do the Custom fasting option as I can stop, start and adjust fasting times as I need to. I also really like that it keeps track of what is happening in the body, or beginning to happen, as fasting hours go by. I've found that knowing what's going on in my body really motivates me to stick it out and fast longer than I set out to most days. I even did my first 36 hour fast with the help of this app! If you're new to fasting or if you're a pro, I highly recommend this app!"
5,Phone,"I'm loving the app, helps me track my water intake, weight, and fasting cycle. You can set reminders on when to eat, not to, and drink. They always have helpful tips and tricks to assist your fasting experience. They offer so many different fasting plans which you mostly  have to Withhold for, however I have a subscription and it's only $10. It mostly gives you access to more plans and tracking storage really. I wouldn't say you neccesarily need to subscribe. I've been using it since 04/21."
5,Phone,"Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!"
5,Phone,"I lost a lot of weight using a cico diet and counting calories and well, i got tired of calorie counting so I've gained about 10lbs lol, but this app has helped me keep myself on track and I'm back to losing weight. The level feature and the info with each level really helps me keep going, little trophies and stuff really help me continue to use the app as well. Edit: I would also love to be able to create a custom end time for the custom fast option, thanks for the app!"
5,Phone,"This app replaced Zero for me. Zero used to be my favorite app before they bloated it to hell with Promotions and membership features and I stopped using it. This app is so much better. I love the UI, it's very cute, it celebrates your progress towards goals even if you didn't completely finish your fast. You have cute articles and are able to track weight and water, as well as adjust start and end times. I only wish there was a way to see monthly how many fasts you completed/failed without scrolling."
5,Phone,"Paid for the ad free version after the first day. Thanks for that option; can't afford a sub, but I like to Withhold some amount. I like that it is simple and provides info on the body's process during the fasting stages. Also, thanks for dark mode! Another review suggested an additional timer of time left in the fast -- great suggestion, please add it."
5,Phone,"I lost 8 pounds in a month using this app!! I'm excited about using this app to lose weight because I'm actually seeing results already:) Also, it was worth Withholding to get Promotions removed since I use the app daily to help keep track of my fasting progress. I love the ability to create a custom plan, add a break day, and the insights are a great resource."
5,Phone,This is my 2nd fasting app and I like it much better. I am still new to it though but the things I like about this that is different fron the 1st app I had is the customization if the fasting schedule I want and the countdown as well as the benefits in each window of time dueing the fast. I look forward to using it more and learning more about its features.
5,Phone,"Just started using this app and it's really helping. I like the custom fasting. One thing I really like is the ability to edit the fast start time, even to the day before. One thing on my wish list (yet to find this ability), I would like to be able to add water to the day before. Often I find myself wanting to update after midnight and it's too late to add."
5,Phone,"Wow this app blew my away. I gave up with fast tracking apps long time ago, they all have Promotions, or some sort of service that you need to purchase to unlock all the features. This has none of that, and gives you probably the best feature I've seen for a fasting tracker: permanent notifications (or constant notifications) at first I didn't like it but when I saw it told me what's happening at this current moment during my fast I was blown away. Right now my blood sugar is rising!"
5,Phone,Not a rookie. But love the app. Easy. simple. Clean interface. Worth it to me for someone who fasts regularly. In depth. Track your water weight activity etc etc syncs with your gadgets. So it is simple or technical. Up to you how you use it. They accomplish the accommodations of all tastes of interface. Get the app. Spend the coin. It's worth it.
5,Phone,"I have to admit, having this app counting down my fast really helps. I thought I could just set up a reminder and that would work but it is not the same. The app has a running notification that tells you the time of your fast as well as what you're feeling physiologically. Highly recommend."
5,Phone,I've been fasting for about a month before getting this app (4-5 times a week 18/6). Decided I liked it but just needed something to help me keep track and this app went above and beyond. My favorite feature is the notification banner that tells you what part of the fast you are in. Using that I was able to tell the food craving I was getting didn't mean I was hungry. Tldr if you are interested in fasting this app is amazing
5,Phone,I love this app. It is very easy to use. It is extremely manageable. You can pretty much set it exactly how you want to personally fast. There are also very interesting articles you can read about the facts on intermittent fasting. It helps me decide if I am ready to eat again or do I keep fasting. It keeps track of all of it in your records. There is even a trophy challenge for how long you have been fasting. Good luck! I highly recommend this app for intermittent fasting.
5,Phone,"So easy to use! I'm several days in, and love how easy it is to start and end my fasting time. It is so easy to adjust if I need to tweak something. I also really enjoy being able to watch how my fasting time is accumulating and to see where in the process various changes are happening to my body. I have been showing this app to everyone I know who fasts or has talked about fasting with me. What a great app!"
5,Phone,"This app has everything I was looking for, but better than I could imagine. Plus it's free. The whole experience is so well done, the reminder to have a sip of water is my favorite part. It is easy to keep track of the confusing parts: when am I burning fat? When am I in ketosis? The positive encouragement I get from using this really keeps me going. This app may end up being a lifesaver for me, literally."
5,Phone,"At first it took some getting used to, I opted to Withhold monthly for the app and I was feeling a little frustrated figuring things out but once I did I found this to be a very useful tool for tracking my fasting time and my water consumption. I've just completed a week of fasting, lost about 5 pounds, and I feel better and healthier than I've felt in a long time. There are things to read to improve your fasting, recipes to try when you're not fasting and other useful tools to encourage you."
5,Phone,"So far this is the best free app for intermittent fasting. A lot of features. I already have a few of my friends using it. In fact, one of them is diabetic and has a problem with late-night overeating. He has been logging the best glucose numbers since he was diagnosed. He said the app has motivated him to take better care of his health and lose weight too. My favorite feature is the hydration reminder. Hydration is now key after donating one of my kidney.. I highly recommend it!"
5,Phone,"This app has helped me to be more mindful of what & when I eat, reminds me to drink water and I have lost weight and feel better. Data is backed up to Google account and restored when I reinstalled the app. It also syncs with Google Fit. The Promotions are a new thing I find bothersome However there is an option to remove Promotions for a small Withholdment. I find this app is work the $4.99 they are asking."
5,Phone,"This app has changed my life, dieting was always very difficult for me, would stick with something for 6 months and lose a bunch of weight then fall off but finally I've found this is for me. Been fasting with the 20 hour split since January and haven't missed a day. The first 2 weeks is hard but gets easier as your body gets use to it. I lost 100 pounds in 7 months keep in mind I'm eating what I want during my eating period. I will use this app for the rest of my life. It's a lifestyle."
5,Phone,"The app is so far helping me to maintain my intermittent fasting, keeping track and raising my awareness of the time, and teaching me about some values of fasting as well as tips to feel good. I've only used the free version so far, but I'm a week into the practice and I can tell that there would value in purchasing the paid version."
5,Phone,This is such a great simple app to use. I'm an experienced faster and just wanted something to keep track of how many hours I'm doing. This app is simple easy to use no crazy Promotions no subscription needed. It saved your info. And being able to see how far into your fast you are and how close I am to being done motivates me to keep going when those hangry urges hit. Seriously recommend for people new to IT this app will really get you to those long fast you strive for. no gimmicks
5,Phone,"This app has really helped me keep track of my goals for intermittent fasting. It keeps me on track and offers valuable tips for when you feel like giving up. I have found that I can fast, be healthy, and feel great at the same time!! I've also dropped weight without really changing my diet, I just not eat as much. Win-win!!"
5,Phone,I really like the costom option. My schedule means I can't follow the main options but having a costom option that allows me to set the time is incredibly useful. I also love the encouragment on level 3 while fasting because it hits home about how the hunger is temporary and just a small signal. I prefer not to fast for more than 16 hours because I'm a working adult and not eating could impact my performance. I basically eat from 9-5. But I work 1-9 so the timing fits.
5,Phone,"Pretty good app, helps me keep track of water intake and my fasting times. It also tells you where you are in your fast and how its benefitting you which adds a bit of motivation in my opinion. Its a lot easier to fast when you're reminded that you're in a ketosis or fat burning state. I started 5 days ago and im down 3 lbs. Planning on keeping it up. (I have the free version)"
5,Phone,"I suck at dieting. If I do a calorie counter I will cheat and not add everything I'm eating. If I want to eat something unhealthy, I want to be able to eat it. Intermittent fasting and using this app has been a huge help with weight loss! The app makes it easy to track your eating/fasting period. Would reccomend to anyone!"
5,Phone,"I like this..I bought the year plan. There was another that was rated high too but cost a lot more. I deleted that and chose this.. now that I've used it, I prefer it over the other. 2/6/23..I went 48 hours on 1 fast..I couldn't believe how good I felt. I found the Fasting time charts make it easier to keep going."
5,Phone,"The app is very helpful in recording and tracking ones progress. (Weight, water intake, fasting clock, BMI index, status info guide during fast) One is able to follow and make adjustments to ones trends. There are other services made available behind a Withholdwall rather inexpensive, that can be useful that I haven't tried yet. In all, I use this app daily and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fasting tracker app"
5,Phone,"A pretty awesome app! I love how it tells me what's going on in my body during each stage if fasting. I've been fasting for almost a year now but decided to try this out for fun during extended fasts. It is definitely motivating. I actually discovered using this app that I tend to fast a few hours longer than I planned most days lol. My only complaint is that I can't figure out how to log water from previous days if I forgot to log it. Anyway, the free version is great for beginner fasters!"
1,Tablet,"Gave up trying to line up the time. I could not for the life of me get the app synced up to my schedule. Then, the extra kicker is that every time I made an adjustment, I would need to watch an ad. I made 5 consecutive changes and watched an ad between each change. Truly obnoxious."
1,Tablet,"Way too aggressive with the ads. And come on with the monthly charge for a mobile fasting app. Everyone is so greedy. Just charge a reasonable rate for app, you dont have to follow the trend of monthly s."
1,Tablet,"It does whatever it s to do apparently. I eat between 4 pm-12am sometimes I eat later ,sometimes I eat earlier.last night I started fasting at 9pm but I just woke up at 4:53pm poorly the app decided to automatically start my eating period while I was asleep AGAIN. Which it's not supposed to do its supposed to overlap the time like it's always done.this is y I dont fw technology like that anymore bcz strange stuff happens."
1,Tablet,An incredible amount of ads permiate the paid version of this app. A full page video ad shilling crypto now appears when I open or close any page in the app. Is 4.9 stars the time to start doing this? I wouldn't think so.
1,Tablet,Why am I being charged again?? I paid $2.99 for the month. I ed to switch type of fast so I ended week I was on early. Now app has locks on everything again. I just paid last week!! Help please
1,Tablet,"This is not real fasting, this is about getting hungry. Real fasting it means to eat non greasy food just healthy like fruits and vegetables, drink a lot of water, eat raw food not cooked. For instance I am fasting every Friday, that means that day I eat only fruits and vegetables, no meat, noo milk products, no eggs, and it is enough to get control over what you choose to eat, and it raises your awareness over eating, as the feeling after fasting day is terrible you strive for healthier food after"
1,Tablet,"I bought a yearly premium , and after 3 months, I start seeing ads and my account become non premium again. This is a scam!"
1,Tablet,"Horrible,never download this app ever as soon as you get in the app it just closes,and as soon as I got in for the first time it was a nightmare,it was lagging so much,it was creepy,it said that someone was watching you,never download this app ever"
1,Tablet,We all put up with adverts to try apps out but this one does not allow you to remove the advert after having read and acknowledged it.
1,Tablet,I don't like it.
1,Tablet,I dont think this is accurate because when u r fasting you cant drink water and this app says that water does not break your fast this absolutly wrong because when you are fasting you are not allowed to drink or eat.it is bad for normal days but its not bad for ramadan.
1,Tablet,It's been terrible... I jxt can't lose wait on my own buh with dis fasting app... I feel bad cos it's lyk a companion Dat guides me with weight loss
1,Tablet,I fell like this shouldn't be an app because of how easily someone can develop an ED from this. So I don't think the app should be rated for everyone.
1,Tablet,Too many nonsense ads. Don't waste your time.
1,Tablet,Way too many advertisement and lagged out and stopped monitoring
1,Tablet,"Couldn't restore premium account, after i switched from ios to android"
1,Tablet,A lot is behind monthly pay wall.
1,Tablet,You guys should have never made this it is not ok to tell people to fast my 23 year old daughter tried it and she ended up in hospital in the ICU center so any one who is doing this please don't this is life threatening if I could give this 0 stars oh don't sought me I would
1,Tablet,Worst app ever ssly its so bad it tells me to leave one meal like ssly
1,Tablet,I don't have money for get premium
1,Tablet,I don't have money for get premium
1,Tablet,Be careful or you will be charged large sums of money
1,Tablet,Why? I can't restore my progress
1,Tablet,I don't like it.
1,Tablet,It was too bad
1,Tablet,No notification
1,Tablet,bad
1,Tablet,bad
1,Tablet,Fasting
1,Tablet,Gud?
1,Tablet,I don't like it.
1,Tablet,stupid app
1,Tablet,Bad
1,Tablet,Worst
1,Tablet,Maksas.
1,Tablet,It was too bad
1,Tablet,Amyzeng
2,Tablet,"App is ok. it's a little bit bloated with useless clatter. Also, there is no option for no weight loss. It forces you to pick up some goals, and there is no way around. The widget of this app is a complete waste of time, had no use, no sense, and it is bizarre. Shame. I wouldn't advice to pay for the premium version."
2,Tablet,"Paid for the premium version. Still got ads. Bought the premium version for the autophagy fasts but there's only a 36 and 48 hrs plus you have to wait for 55 hr eating window before it will start. Theres no way to start an autophagy fast immediately. The custom  feature doesn't work. I read in another post that the ""custom "" feature will be coming later. Why have the feature? This is just a pretty timer that has a few notifications that has very little customization. Dont bother"
2,Tablet,Terrible UX. Ending fasting and starting a  again gets frustrating if you use the paid version. Ads are huge and in your face and pop up between selections. Kinda suspect this is the highest rated fasting app...
2,Tablet,"Just some (paid on google) interesting advice. The monitorer is Useless junk. don't waste your money. NOTE..The developer responded with a suggestion that after spending $20., I should spend more on the Premium product ..... FAT chance....."
2,Tablet,I don't see anywhere that I can monitor my food on this app. Makes it kind of useless.
2,Tablet,Cannot adjust my fasting time when I fast longer than my selection.
2,Tablet,"It all sounds right, but can I do it? I think I can!??"
2,Tablet,Ni information and of guides if you don't buy
2,Tablet,The same few recipes options!
2,Tablet,bad
2,Tablet,bad
2,Tablet,I don't see anywhere that I can monitor my food on this app. Makes it kind of useless.
3,Tablet,"I installed the app on 2 devices (phone & tablet). I paid for the yearly subscription and enabled Google Fit integration. But the 2 devices are out of sync! I had to enter my details and select a fasting schedule twice! And even though I set and have been following a daily schedule, it shows me that I have been fasting for over 2 days, as if it's expecting me to manually log the fasting start/end times each day!? ???????"
3,Tablet,"I've been testing this app for more weeks, and I like it. Is there an option to MANUALLY IMPORT or migrate fasting data from another app (LIFE Fasting, for example) or MANUALLY ADD the entries FOR MORE THAN THE LAST 10 DAYS? If this is impossible, then I will have to stick with the same apps that I've been using until now, because I really care about ALL MY FASTING HISTORY. (Your answer suggests that you didn't read the last part of my message. I've edited my review so you can see what I mean.)"
3,Tablet,"Functional app, but way too many ads, and they're long ads. I could upgrade, but would have liked to try it out longer to see if I like it."
3,Tablet,I don't get it. Why an app? Been doing IF for 13 months so far. While searching something else I saw and installed this app. Tons of info included. A bit of overwhelm. Simple solution skip one meal a day to limit eating during any eight hour window of your choosing. Mine is noon till 8p.m. No app needed. And no excuses preventing fasting. 'Oh I forgot to set a reminder today guess I'll fast tomorrow.'
3,Tablet,"The ui is not very good but the constant information I love it. I can't do 24hr fasting in the app, it will not allow me I don't like it. If the app had one life time buy option for like 30$ I would buy it. You have a good app that can be awesome just needs some work."
3,Tablet,A one time fee to get rid of ads would be sufficient. A monthly fee for information that can be found on the web for free or maybe an eBook just isn't it and kind of a insult to intelligence.
3,Tablet,"The app is good, the weak point is the monotonous meal plan, that cannot be adjusted"
3,Tablet,I eat at about 8 p.m. in the evening and then I don't eat until noon one the next day and I keep my meals small but I treat myself a little bit once in awhile I'm quite handicapped so I don't move an awful lot but I do believe in fasting and Dr.Oz also has spoken on this subject
3,Tablet,Whenever I use the app it immediately drains all my battery out... Leap fitness group pls try to fix it
3,Tablet,Too many/frequent Ads ??
3,Tablet,Good but please add vegetarian option.
3,Tablet,"They are good they are great but when they are not, they really sucks."
3,Tablet,"I fast 24hrs once a week. No support for that in here. Also, sources for your health claims would be more persuasive"
3,Tablet,I bin fasting sins I was 8 it's my familie's tradition to fast wen your pretty big so for dose who's are doing dis for the first time believe me wen I say at first its gonna by hard but the more you do it you can see it's not dat hard so don't quit please take my word for it ??
3,Tablet,Custom area ... won't let me change anything. I want to do 40 hours
3,Tablet,Nice app
3,Tablet,"ok,"
3,Tablet,"ok,"
4,Tablet,Great app!
4,Tablet,"This app is really good , I have been fasting for just a week and I can already see and feel a difference, it reminds me to stay hydrated and tracks my progress along the way, all while further educating me on both physical and mental well being. I find that it has helped me to lower my calorie consumption and I do feel alot lighter tbh. 10/10 recommend ????"
4,Tablet,"Bang for the buck! App is really good. Though, meal planning menu is limited,still better than most IF tracking app in play store. Provides different IF plans depending on your comfort. Tracks water intake, weight tracking, and infos on IF planning. Giving 4 stars coz of the VERY limited menu. Hope they add more."
4,Tablet,"I haven't experienced the final results of this yet but I am currently getting the results.I believe that someone who does this really correctly can get rid of obesity very easily. Another special thing about this is the look of it. It's very interesting.When you look at it, anyone wants to do it.This is a really good design. We can learn a lot more from this.Especially the scientific facts and why we should do this. This will be very successful if you add sleeping pattern and exercise pattern."
4,Tablet,"This app is really helpful,motivational and easy to use ?? Just one thing i recommend is to make it possible to switch back and forth between the previos days instead of having to go back and look for the next days date ,this way i can read the notes i left easily (hope you understood what i mean ??), Other than that its an amazing app ,I highly recommend it ?? Thank you so much for making this app ?"
4,Tablet,Easy to navigate and straight forward app. I'd like to try the membership program but not sure if I want to invest in that just yet. Some content is locked without the membership.
4,Tablet,It's a good app and I love it
4,Tablet,"although the app itself is amazing, no Promotions and theres some membership features ofcourse. but it will not help u with any sort of weightloss. ive been on a diet of 1200 calories or less for months now with 16:8 fast and ive lost no weight, infact, ive remained my exact weight and sometimes im even heavier than before. it isnt smt to do when av.weight, mainly useful for overweight ppl or people who are looking for other benefits."
4,Tablet,"It's an incredible helpful app, but such a shame that the notifications/reminders not work. The notification bar just disappears after a few hours of using the app."
4,Tablet,"after using this app for weeks and eating only 3 meals a day plus my dessert after dinner with a snack allowed between each meal, and also working out throughout the week lightly, i lost 14 pounds. im really happy with my results and this is only using the 14-10 and 16-8 fasting times."
4,Tablet,Great app to keep my going! I keep fasting and it is fun to track my time because when I finish I get a big celebration ??! The only problem is that you have to Withhold for some big fasts so I fast out of the app I pause tej fast for a few hours but I am actually still fasting!
4,Tablet,Actually a good fasting app. Only problem is I can't go membership because it says I haven't got Google play even though I downloaded the app from Google play. Edit its working now.
4,Tablet,"Great clean app, does what is expected. Subscribed, but wished I noticed the widget only have water intake? Would be great to have a fast timer widget to quickly glance at."
4,Tablet,"Great App., with lots of visual appeal, but also armed with ultra aggressive marketing elements that can be obstructive, attimes."
4,Tablet,Very nice dashboard and helpful so far. Swhitchrd to membership to see what more i can get from the app
4,Tablet,I prefer not to know if I paid I never used the app before and when I saw the membership page j unistaled the app so if I paid can j have my money back ty
4,Tablet,Easy app to use just a shame there's no way to change water measurements from floz to ml.
4,Tablet,I love this app then now i wanted to gain weight but i  like the others so can you make a gaining app just like this
4,Tablet,"Love this app.. lose my weight about 5 kg per month but when i start to uninstall, 1 gain weight again??"
4,Tablet,Nice app wish it included 36 and 48 to 72 hours
4,Tablet,Easy app to use just a shame there's no way to change water measurements from floz to ml.
4,Tablet,Im still learning but its a great interface
4,Tablet,"Ive only just installed this app, but i like it already. Q: Can i choose the day of the fast myself when im on a plan?"
4,Tablet,This app is very useful and easy to use
4,Tablet,"Very detailed ,,,love it"
4,Tablet,Nice????????????
4,Tablet,very helpful
4,Tablet,Wishlist
5,Tablet,"This app tracks fasting, and not much else. It does what it was designed to do, and I like it. I could keep track of fasting times myself, but with this app, I prefer not to have to. It also gives pointers, suggests different plans and the merits of each. As an IF newbie, I appreciate the support I get from this app. Even though diets generally not work for me, I've steadily lost about 1.3 pounds per week over the last month, and I feel wonderful."
5,Tablet,Great fasting app for intermittent fasting which is new to me. Very easy to use. My only complaint or recommendation for changing within the application would be the custom fasting option. It would be nice to actually set start and end times or create a custom fasting plan that may involve multiple start and end times within a day. Otherwise very easy to use and it's a good application.
5,Tablet,I really love this app. The fasting plans are good and can be adapted to a person's eating schedule. And all the essential information provided in the app really helps in staying informed and safe.
5,Tablet,"I have been using this app for some months now and it's one of the best apps for fasting. If you are considering intermittent fasting then this the app to download. I love the tips they give you during fasting hours and there's different types of plans, challenges and fasting methods to choose from. Am currently doing adf and this app has been a great tool for motivation."
5,Tablet,It is quite helpful.It guides me accordingly. However I am in Zimbabwe and failing to make a Withholdment. Is there any other Withholdment I can use. Like western union or world remit.
5,Tablet,"Nice app, I would like it to be free as they do run adds. like the simple design. if it was like a one off Withholdment of £5 I'd probably Withhold for it."
5,Tablet,"This is a really great app to use for fasting. I have used this so many times and lost a lot of weight using the app. Using the suggested intermittent time helps to keep me accountable so I prefer not to eat when I'm not suppose to. Love it to help kick start a weight loss journey however, the thing to note about fasting apps and such especially if your problem is food is that if you not control what and how much you eat then you just gain the weight right back and that would have all been for nothing"
5,Tablet,It works pretty well and keep u updated and also encouraged you to push yourself harder
5,Tablet,Very good. I can find no issues with this app. I prefer not to feel hungry in fact for this past week I want to continue with this every now and then fast. Thanks for including my thoughts.
5,Tablet,"Custom fasts and long fast (yeah!) water reminder & tracking (custom/set quantities), flexible notifications. Nice graphic design. I like to see in which phase my body is. Promotions are not overly annoying and I also like the fact that I can choose to Withhold a one off fee to have the Promotions removed without purchasing the coaching plans. I will do that to support the dev team because it really does for me absolutely everything I need. Good statistic as well. Dev idea: add logs for fat% and body measurements."
5,Tablet,I love the app. I just need to remember to turn on notifications.
5,Tablet,I like the access to different articles for fasting on the app.
5,Tablet,Great app tracks fasting hours gives great tips and telling what state your bodys in are only some of the features ??????
5,Tablet,Good app as it shows how im doing and what stage I'm at. Thumbs up!
5,Tablet,"Amazing! At first, I didn't really like the app but then when I started using it every day. I saw how amazing it was in helping me fast and diet and lose weight. The insights that it gives in the app are amazing and very true. I tested my blood sugar after a certain amount of hours into my fast and it was low like the app said it would be, exactly at that amount of time that had passed. This App was clearly designed by a person or people that know what they're talking about!"
5,Tablet,It really works for me... I have reduced 1.5kg in a week's time without tired or exercise ?? I haven't purchased the app since i want to give a try...but will purchase soon
5,Tablet,It's a helpful tool to track your intermittent fasting I highly recommend it I'm using it since 2018 ????
5,Tablet,"This app really helps! I have only used it for 1 week but I really like it! The water reminder is helpful so that I am sure to achieve my desired daily water intake. The features are customizable so that I can have a reminder to drink as often as I'd like. I also like the little tips that are provided. Not too much to read but just enough to provide ""food for thought"". I started the week at 389.6lbs and I am currently at 380.9lbs, one week later using the 14-10 IF cycle. Let's go!"
5,Tablet,"I've tried another IF app, and by far this one beats it. If I've forgotten to press start or stop, I'm SO thankful that I can set my time to correct my oversight. Makes it so much easier to keep in the IF mindset, daily, and keep the motivation up. PLUS, I feel I'm cleansing out the negative emotions...weird and incredible at the same time"
5,Tablet,"I love this! I'm kind of at a plateau as of now, but I know that's normal for weight loss and it will continue downward soon. In about a month, I went from 172 -> 160! And my waist went from 37/38 in to 32in... I feel super healthy and I can still eat things I like! I highly recommend this for people who want to lose weight and it does help to exercise or go biking every day. Used the 20-4 plan :)"
5,Tablet,"Reading the beneficial stage of fasting is encouraging. When I read it, it makes me want to do longer and longer, until the state that I'm too hungry. Then I stop. After eating, then I get back on fasting. I personally find the app is good for my extended fasting, not for daily intermittent fasting which tight timing could be quite stressful. Extended fasting without specific time period gives me more space. Then I can easily do 40-48-72 hour fasting, and enjoy reading what stage I'm in."
5,Tablet,"Want to beginn intermittent fasting then you WANT THIS APP! It tells you all the pertinent information before youy beginn your assessment to decide what level you will be the most successful with. Throughout the day you'll recieve encouragement, hydration, as well as, what's happening in your body and continues as you progress. This apps great you'll love it, and love intermittent fasting because of it!"
5,Tablet,"Intuitive! This is my 4th app I've tried and so far the best. On the free version, Customize and edit fasting times, during your fast a window is displayed that tells you what your body is doing during each hour of your fast which motivates me to try and go longer. No other FREE a has this!"
5,Tablet,"I never tried fasting before but when I decided to try intermittent fasting I installed several apps to see which one I would use to fast. Since it was my 1st time fasting I wanted something that made it seem fun, exciting and interesting. Also wanted an easy to use interface. This Fasting App is the one I chose and this is my 5th day of fasting! Thank you I love this app??"
5,Tablet,"It is such a cool app. When I did it the first time it was not so planned and structured but with this one I think l will reach my goals. My previous intermittend fasting was over a period of 3 years and I lost 35kg over a 3 year span. I had so much energy, I was focused I was ready for any eventuallity. I moved mountains, small ones but I moved them. This is the best eating plan and it was practiced by our forefathers thousands of years ago. In any event we eat way more than we should:-)"
5,Tablet,This app makes it super easy to do intermittent fasting and tells you what stages of your fast you're in at all times. The free version is awesome. There are only occasional Promotions. Super satisfied with this app. Fantastic!
5,Tablet,"Little to no Promotions, it's not shoved down your throat. It's a very simple app with fun facts about where you are in your fasting progress. I love the simple layout of this app, too. It's very nice for anyone already doing intermittent fasting or is just starting!"
5,Tablet,I love it. It's simple and not an intimidating app. I've just used it for 5 days but it has been helping me fairly well. I love how it tells me which stage i am in my fasting which inspires me to keep going. I may have not explored it well enough but i'm still finding a way how it can alarm me when my window hours is about to finish.
5,Tablet,"Nice app, but if it's not asking too much, can you all please make this compatible with the Galaxy Smartwatch 5 Pro? All you need to put on there is a timer so I prefer not to have to dig for my phone to check and see how much time I have left until my fast is over. Of course, I can always get used to the time, but it's just a suggestion."
5,Tablet,Great app...it keeps track of how long you've been fasting so you not have too and you can create your own fast! Also love that it tells you what mode your body goes into the longer you fast! Great tips to keep you motivated too and also a water tracker!
5,Tablet,"Great app! It tracks your weight loss, reminds you when you have fasted for too long, and it is overall just very good! If you are struggling with your weight, definitely download this!"
5,Tablet,"what's great about this app is that it gives you an information about whats happening to your body stage by stage. there is a positve psychological effect and it will drive you and makes you more motivated to do fasting. and you will be surprise with the output. I was 88 Kg from Day1 and now I am 79Kg on Day15... i will continue until I hit my goal at 69Kg... Guess what, I prefer not to feel weak... and still can do burpees and pushups with ease. great app... Thanks..."
5,Tablet,The best fasting app I have ever used. Easy and very informative.
5,Tablet,Best app for weight loss
5,Tablet,"This is the best app I've found to record flexible fasts. You can choose your start time, duration and end time. Very easy to use. You can also record other information like water intake and weight if you want to."
5,Tablet,Very easy to use. The free trial has been more than enough.
5,Tablet,"loving this app,especially the notifications that keeps you motivated through the fast.this is simple to use and keeps record of your fast history,I have upgraded this app which eliminates adds,I would recommend for people who are new to fasting and want to have some guidance and feedback through their progress"
5,Tablet,"Really good and easy to use, it's helping me understand fasting better and what it does to my body. I've been feeling more energetic and less bloated since I started. Now I get to fast for 20 hours without even flinching. Update: 6 weeks and lost 10 lbs (nearly 5kg)"
5,Tablet,Great app. I've recently started my weight loss journey and this app has been a huge help. I started at about 210 lbs about 4 months ago now I'm down to 180 lbs!! Its motavational and supportive! I highly recommend this app if you're looking to lose weight and get control of you're eating habits!
5,Tablet,"VERY HELPFUL! It keeps track of fasting/eating time for you, provides helpful information about what is happening to your body while fasting, reminds you to drink water, and just makes things easier! Very happy I found this!"
5,Tablet,"Great app, so easy to use. Love how you get the niceges to show your achievements ??. So good how you can track your weight, measurements and water intake as well."
5,Tablet,"Love this app. Day 1 was easy doing a 18:6 fast. App tracks u fasting time, great tips for encouragement, easy to set your start weight etc. Tells you when you go into ketosis (body use the fat reserves) friendly to use. Awesome."
5,Tablet,"I love that it keeps me mindful of my fasting and helps me not to be Anxious about completing a fast. I love how it walks you through every stage, which is what helped encourage me to be more aggressive with my fasting."
5,Tablet,This is the best app to lose weight. I can't believe that in just one week I lost 2 KG. It also encouraged me to drink more water because in the fasting period you can only drink water or herbal tea. This app deserves more than 5 stars. ???????????
5,Tablet,Immediately impressed! I could quickly input my data and it is so full of custom parts that it works well. Deleted my other app and paid the yearly for this one.
5,Tablet,"Great app, lots of features in Free version. Reminders to Drink water. Shows time to eat, Time to Fast, how much time is left in each etc."
5,Tablet,"It's amazing and very organized, it would be better if we could track what we eat outside of fasting too but it's great just the way it is also."
5,Tablet,"I never thought I would write a review on Google playstore, but I really wanted to write a review about this app because it's that good. This app is really nice, everything is well defined and well specified. I saw a difference only in 2 days. I am fully satisfied??"
5,Tablet,Makes keeping track of fasting do easy!
5,Tablet,"I am a little over a week using this program and I am enjoying it so far. My only problem is trying to add my water consumption every time, for some reason I prefer not to like the way it is setup. But the app is great."
5,Tablet,"This app is the best, it keeps track of how long you've fasted, how much steps you've taken and how much water you drink. I haven't been able to find a better app 10/10 recommend."
5,Tablet,"A really great guideline in terms of food consumption(..more protein and nuts..)and dehydration.I have never drank so much of water in many years coz i really  like the taste of water.Successfully,i replaced my 2nd cup of coffee with water and even my late night coffee.Im proud of myself."
5,Tablet,"Great app to keep track of IF. I have been using the app for more than a month now, i have the pro version. Lost 7kg in 30 days, great insights and tips to support your IF. Recommend this for anyone planning to start IF. Thx developer"
5,Tablet,"Brilliant. Helping me stay motivated and helping keep the fasts enjoyable. Yearly membership is a steal. Thank-you. P.s, only slight gripe is I can't transfer membership to my ios device from android. But this app still thoroughly deserves 5 stars."
5,Tablet,Excellent APP. Helps keep you focused. Count down feature showing how long you have fasted Lots of different options available
5,Tablet,This app has been really helpful as part of my weight loss programme. It's so easy to use and really motivational.
5,Tablet,"Good non-invasive app. Gives info and orientation for intermitent fasting. But, ultimately, is up to you."
5,Tablet,It has been a great start. The app is fantastic for beginners. It keeps me on track. Superb free app. A must have for beginners. Great job guys!
5,Tablet,Love it! Simple and easy to use. I especially appreciate the info on what my body is going through at each phase of the fasting state. Very informative.
5,Tablet,"Lots of info, helps push you to hit your goals, and it helped me reduce portion sizes, too. Great app!"
5,Tablet,"Excellent app for tracking weight loss, fasting periods and water intake. Using in conjunction with the Fast 800 Keto diet gives a good base of recipes too. Lost 7lbs in 7 days so something is working!"
5,Tablet,Really good no complaints at all it does not push buying membership and it lets you do your own thing sometimes it gets annoying on other apps cuz they try to push everything at one time this app just like take it slow take and easy I love it so much
5,Tablet,Really detailed dashboard and the infomation about what's happening during the fast is great. I also love the big timer.
5,Tablet,Please add the OMAD 23/1 that will Make this App the best fasting tracker ever. I have used both Zero and Life IF apps and this is just as good if not better. The interface is good.
5,Tablet,"Really great app, real-time fasting timer and tips are really good. Only been using it for for a week and lost 4lbs already."
5,Tablet,"Actually valuable helpful hints, decent layout, smooth operation, motivational effect. 0 complaints - nice job."
5,Tablet,This is the best fasting app ever. Has levels of fasting and what is happening each hour of your fast. It even has a weight tracker.
5,Tablet,Really amazing do fat i have gone 4 days do this and this app is amazing. I wish i could get preuim but i cant.I am not able to get preuim due to not have a credit card on google play and i cant use my parents credit cards
5,Tablet,Honestly its a great app it helps you throughput the day but it would help more if I put more effort in i sometimes cheat on the diet ??????but its all good becayse this app helps you get back on track
5,Tablet,This app helps in every aspects to improve health get a good physical appearence and everything. And because of that i gave it 5 stars because they deserve it.
5,Tablet,Best app
5,Tablet,It is awesome..Highly recommend this app...suberb...but please make it like 1 or 2 week challenge to lose 1or2 kg of weight it will be more good for me..so it wan't take much time for weight loss...
5,Tablet,"It's a very good app! It was easy to use but, it would be best if their is an alarm as a reminder. But overall it's a pretty decent app!!"
5,Tablet,"I love the app very much,it is very easy to follow,I love all the tips and tricks to stay focus in your plan."
5,Tablet,"Great app, helped me well in keeping track of my fasting. Would recommend it to those that fast. Great for beginners too."
3,Phone,"There's a lot of bloat, and the app sometimes takes a long time to load, but overall it's fairly functional Edit: to be clear, the app only takes long to load from a cold start because the first thing it loads is an ad for a subscription, which usually takes about 8 seconds. Edit 2: yes, this also happens if my phone is in airplane mode."
3,Phone,"This app is okay, but I think I could have figured this all out by myself by doing research and keeping my own records, without paying the money. I don't really care about badges. I am not sharing them with anybody. What this app needs to justify the cost is a calorie counter. As in, one that you can enter your food, and it tells you the calories. A bit annoyed at myself for thinking there would be more benefits for what I actually paid for."
3,Phone,"It's ok, but too ad-heavy, and I need to be able to interact with the notification without it constantly closing."
3,Phone,"I regret paying for this app. It doesn't stay in the notification panel. It has reminder settings, but you only get the reminder when you open the app. If I'm opening the app then I don't need a reminder. Followed the developer's suggestion and it did not help. Big waste of money."
3,Phone,"The app itself is very good, but the ads in free version are infuriating. ~1 minute unskippable full screen video ad, really? I'm so annoyed I don't even want to consider paying for the app."
3,Phone,"Wish there was more free options for tips and tricks, and besides that great app, help me lose 10 on the first week and a halve"
3,Phone,"This is the best fasting app I've seen. Unfortunately, a subscription isn't viable unless new content is regularly released. Some of the blog posts have inaccurate or misleading content. A one time fee makes more sense without regularly updated content."
3,Phone,unskippable ads. I literally can't go inside the app even if I wait for the ads to finish. I had to force close and reopen the app at least 3 times until I get different type of ads that is skippable everytime I want to use the app.
3,Phone,"Love the design, but it is surprisingly complicated to set up your own simple fasting schedule, and you have to manually re-enter it every week unless you pay for the subscription."
3,Phone,"I used to love it. I used to be able to just start & stop my fasting,  & now it's making me follow their timing,  whether I am fasting then or not. It's not helpful now"
3,Phone,"I start my fasting yesterday and after my phone turned off and then on, my fasting reset and there is no record of my current fasting except for my previous fasting. I have to input it every times I restart my phone?"
3,Phone,Reminders of starting and ending fasting aren't working though I toggled them on on the app . Only the drink water reminder works . I redownload the app twice and still didn't get any reminders
3,Phone,The app is good but there should be an option for choosing vegetarian diet plan. The dirt options provided are all a mix of both non-veg and veg.
3,Phone,"This used to be my go to app, but the ads are too annoying to deal with. There are now better versions of the app, and they don't have near the amount of ads this does."
3,Phone,"Functionality not great on android. Using app on a Samsung 10+. Once you set your desired fasting window, i haven't figured out a way to change it. Also, i don't have an option to extend my fasting window. Apparently there's supposed to be a reminder/ option to keep fasting but it doesn't pop up on my screen so I'm stuck on a 14/10 cycle. I've given up trying to figure it all out. My wife uses the app on her ipx and the user interface is way better. No issues for her at all."
3,Phone,"This app is almost great, but in so many areas it just falls a little short, and all those little things together make for a bit of a disappointing experience. Some improvements I'd like to see are: being able to edit the fasting entries more thoroughly (the notes, the difficulty etc), even if you choose a fasting goal, if you go above and beyond for the entry to automatically adjust (I usually just choose 14-10,but I almost always fast 20 hrs, but all my entries say 14-10 because it doesn't auto adjust that), in the entry logs for it to show the number of hours you fasted without having to click on each entry, having more than 3 difficulty responses to a fast (would like to see at least 5), to also be able to select from a variety of emoticons or ""stamps"" to be able to apply to entries as a sort of emotional journal or journal of other things (to keep track of emotions, days I exercised, days I had junk food, etc), I'd also like to see more little awards, they have it for first fast and then on a weekly basis, but I'd like to see little achievement badges for meeting goals, using features, entering each ""level"", even doing a fast again after a difficult day (the not giving up badge). Some of that stuff are just fluff changes, but it's like what they have (the emotional response and the trophies) are just enough to make you realize it could be a great feature while completely falling short of being useful."
3,Phone,"Ok, but.. I dont like that I have to manually enter the fasting and eating period. I'd prefer it if the app just notify me about it and change it itself. Because I forget to change it, lets say I'm on the way somewhere, and it still shows fasting even the next day, and doesn't notify me anymore about the next periods. My adhd brain doesnt like it. I would like it if it gives me clear instructions about when I can eat and when I can't. But for that I can just use the phone alarm with labels :)"
3,Phone,"Using the free version so maybe it's different if you pay for it but even though I entered my weight in lbs and my water goal in ml, every time I open the app it has defaulted back to kg and oz, it's really irritating having to change it back every time. Other than that it seems simple enough to use and is great for reminding me to drink water"
3,Phone,"Even with free version usability is good. Recent features like ""insights which are total garbage take stars off. Used to be simple and functional, now complicated, cluttered and full of false info claims. Timeline feature is fancy instead of readable (would much prefer a table of info over fancy boxes), but, for free software, this is one of the best."
3,Phone,"This is a really great app, I do recommend it. The only thing which is frustrating about it, is the custom fasting plan is 8 days long, which means if you use it every week (which I do), you have to keep recalibrating it to give different fasting periods on the weekend. It would be so much easier if it ran for seven days, then you could keep the same plan each week. Please can you fix that soon :-) apart from that its fantastic. Very customisable and easy to use."
3,Phone,"On the whole I like it. 2 big gripes: can only show time increasing, you cannot set it to show the time counting down. Also the 'custom' time doesn't really do anything, because you cannot really set the end time. So it's just a timer. Improve those and it would be a 5 star app. Also it seems you can't edit the weekly plans either. I'll look for something else."
3,Phone,"The app is stable, and performs as it should. It is for entry-level fasters, those looking for motivation. I have doing OMAD for an year and a half now, and what I'd like to see is a better integrated app with the meals calories, their last and frequency. It should give the possibility of breaking the fast with the calories, and calculate the time it takes to go back into ketosis."
3,Phone,"I'm in the fence with this app. I paid for the premium version. GOOD: easy to use and simple in the sense that the info they provide is easy to follow. A good handful of recipes. BAD, don't agree with annual charge of $25 unless they plan on updating new content. No info on supplements like pre-workouts / BCAAs. which are good, which to avoid. Especially sweeteners like stevia, there are many that aren't pure in ingredients and could disrupt fasting. Recommended products would be nice."
3,Phone,"Just downloaded the app and it seems like a reasonably good app for tracking fasts and has everything that the average user would need. The main issue I picked up almost instantly is that when you are editing the starting date of a fast you are limited to going back 10 days, this seems like a senseless and arbitrary restriction. I started my fast on the 31st of December, but can only backdate my start point to the 3rd of January which kind of defeats the reason for having the app, to accurately keep track of my hours fasted."
3,Phone,"Great app, too many ads. I have tried most fasting apps and this is by far the best. I particularly like the info on what my body is doing stage by stage. Plenty of choice so finding a fasting regime to suit us pretty easy. Now for the down side, and it's bad enough for me to be 50/50 about using it. The same adds appear constantly and take for ever and ever and ever before you can X out of it. I don't mind the occasional ad that lasts about 3 to 5 seconds but the Phillips ad goes on and on and."
3,Phone,The app is okay. It is well built and isn't glitchy. Build-wise i would give the app 5 stars. The problem I had is that what it could do was limited. It is one big timer with no way to track every meal. If it had a function similar to the one for water where we can mark each meal it would be great. Even better would ve to have the chance to write down what the meal was.
3,Phone,"For the past months that i tried 16-8 and longer, it worked fine. Just this month i tried to lessen the fasting time to 12:12 and there is somehow mistake on time computation. Fast time jan 6 - 23:30 and end jan 7 - 13:00 but it shows 10 hrs and 29mins only, even if it lapsed 12hrs already. Can't attached ss here to show proof."
3,Phone,The app is nice. But keep working in background drains the mobile battery. It's better to send notification only.
3,Phone,I still use it but some of the ads now require you to wait a full minute before you can get to the data to edit your info. The ads are too much
3,Phone,"Nice and simple, but from time to time it stops sending me notifications"
3,Phone,"I do like this app, hence the reason why I subscribed for the year. Unfortunately, it seems to completely ignore my normal meal times when setting up a plan. I have set my breakfast for 7:30 AM and lunch at 4:00 PM but the 15-9 plan sets my eating period to 6:30 AM - 3:30 PM. I can go in and edit them individually but it seems a bit illogical to even ask for the user's meal times, if they aren't considered when assigning a plan. The app looks very good but the function isn't as good as the form."
3,Phone,"Slightly annoying that you can't seem to be able to change the start time of your fast. so if I stop eating at 7pm and remember at 8pm that ""oh yea, have to update the app"", I can't choose the start time of the fast. The app will insist that I have only been fasting since 8pm, so the counter will always show the wrong amount of hours fasted. The ""details"" part is correct, but the elapsed time is not at all. Edit: also confusingly the app looks different this week than the last. Idk why."
3,Phone,I like how simple this app is to use but there is room for improvement. Two things I have had problems with. 1. If I forget to add a drink during or at the end of the day there doesn't seem to be a way I can edit the date/ time. I would like to amend the data so I don't have to log drinks in the app as they happen. 2. I forget sometimes to enter the start time of a fast and it can be messy to try to retrospectively fix the data. Other than that i have found the app helpful and encouraging.
3,Phone,"Wish the UI was simpler to use and more user friendly/intuitive. If I forget to end my fast in the app, the timer keeps continuing and then I have to go in and manually edit it and it's really cumbersome. I wish it did that by itself according to the time I've set and I could just track my weight. If I start the fasting timer Monday night, forget about it on Tuesday and remember Wednesday, I have to go back and manually enter Monday first and then Tuesday and then start the timer again for Wed."
3,Phone,"I have a yearly subscription paid for premium access, but this has been removed since the last update a couple of months ago. I have tried reaching out the developer by email, but still no reply. Can someone help me with this? It is quite frustrating to have ads constantly popping up when I paid in order to not have to deal with them. I love the app, but due to customer service I cannot give more than 3 starts at the moment."
3,Phone,"The app, in theory is great at keeping track of your fasting and non-fasting periods. There is a button to start fasting and one to stop fasting. If you forgot to stop the fasting, then you can go an adjust the time. The problem is, it doesnt always remember when you have told it you have stopped fasting and the next thing you know, the app thinks you have been fasting for over 24 hours. This is very frustrating and has not given me enough confidence in the app to do a paid upgrade."
3,Phone,"I started using this app for a weightloss journey. The app had times you could click on and voila!, you're fasting. However, I noticed that scheduling personal timetable on the app comes with its own problems. App waits for you to click the start and end time of your fast if you're not using their recommended plans and if you fail to input this daily, you can't go back and do that, so you end up loosing your progress. Please, change this feature so I can go back to each day and manually input it"
3,Phone,I really wish there was a way to add custom plans without doing it manually. I just want to set a start/end time and get the phase updates along the way.
3,Phone,"Very good but! I liked it, it's easy, but i have many problems with, please care for them 1_ its notificatios sound or vibration for every passes second and that's annoying 2_it doesn't alarm me when its time to stop eating or stop fasting and vise versa. 3_ when i enter the app to see the time of eding fast, it calulates from time i enter it but not from the real time i already started .. Thanks for your efforts, hope for this app more of success"
3,Phone,"Only 3* cos its so static. Once you have read the info you have read it. I don't like the bar chart display of total daily fasting hours as its too simple. Easy to use, I've tried a couple of others and this is much better because it's realiable and easy to amend non standard fasting hours."
3,Phone,"Good but more work needed. Too manual. It counts the time, but the reminders and notifications don't work all the time, so you have to remember to go in and stop the fasting/eating times and the go in again and edit the time you actually stopped/started eating. Sometimes I think setting reminders in my phone directly might actually do a better job than the app."
3,Phone,"Great app! Free version is very customizable! Was impressive, now too many invasive ads!"
3,Phone,"Overall helpful app but the new weeks when I forget to set the plan on time now gives inaccurate info. It shows the time I started it at even though the plan should have started earlier (ie. I started fasting at 6pm, but started this around 6:15 but I can't adjust or change the time to reflect the actual minutes in when I change it back to 6pm it won't add that 15 minutes). It used to but somewhere this broke and needs to be fixed."
3,Phone,"Too many ads and not flexible enough So I paid the subscription to remove the ads and unlock Alternate Day fasting, instead of custom. On custom you can start and stop the clock. On alternate day you can't. It assumes u will start eating at midnight even if you set yiur breakfast time to 2pm! So if I stop at 8pm, fast a day and eat again noon the next day, it only records 24hrs instead or nearly 40 fasting. So it's not practical because anything but custom, is not editable to record real time"
3,Phone,"This may be just a me problem, but it bothers me so much that in the 'daily' page I have fasting records of 32h but the 'me' page says that my longest fast was 24h long"
3,Phone,"It's a decent app, except for lack of flexibility in modifying fasting times/lengths. The paid susbscription is a waste of money though, nothing really usefull to pay an extra buck. I wish there was a IF tracker that is more attuned to the female menstrual cycle, that would have been something worth paying."
3,Phone,Easy to follow for beginners!
3,Phone,"You really need to add more healthy food recipes, as there's totally not enough of them!"
3,Phone,"When I first downloaded this app, it seemed mundane and almost too plain. But after loading another app and tried to use it, I realised plain means clear and easy to follow. I love your app. Gets to the point and allows for one to truly ulter their eating patterns and your app then adjusts itself to assist the faster when to start their next meal. LOOOOOOVEEEE!!!"
3,Phone,"I've just downloaded this hence the threes stars so far. I'm using this to start on a 14:10 plan to then work up to the 16:8 plan. I don't have scales at home, so was going to measure around my legs, arms, waist and hips to help monitor for any changes. Would be great if there was somewhere in the programme to add this as a way to keep track. Many thanks all!"
3,Phone,"Annoying Glitch Cannot change fasting END time to show today's date! My fast was done at 130pm but I forgot to stop the app until 345pm and it won't let me change to reflect proper end time. Frustrating! Up until this started, I really liked the app and therefore 3 stars because I'm still hoping they will fix this issue."
3,Phone,"It's a great app, but the only downside for me is that I can't split my fasting into two parts. I skip lunch, but it shows me as eating for 16 hours a day instead of allowing me to set up my plan as 4 hours in the morning, and 4 hours in the evening, and still account for my fasting during sleep. Other than that, it's a great app."
3,Phone,"This is truly the best fasting app, but I can't give 5 stars until they make a widget that shows your fasting time, they only have one that shows your water intake that I don't really use. In app, everything is great, it has its bugs sometimes like continuing my fast after I end it, but this happens far less than any other app I've used. Please make a good widget though!"
3,Phone,"I really like this app, so I'm really sad to give it three stars and to replace it with another. The app keeps crashing on me. I'll open it and it will close out right away. At first I was able to fix this for short periods of time by resetting my phone, but eventually that stopped working and I just cannot open it anymore. Otherwise, it's a great app that does just what I needed it to do."
3,Phone,"I like it, even though it's confusing to navigate through it because of the advs. Stupidly, bought a meal plan from another app thinking that was this app (LOL, they got me). I'm working on getting my refund. They advertise everything except their own products."
3,Phone,I've been using this app every time I fast. The app very good and with the deals the pricing gets better as well. The only request is to add a widget to end and start the fast. I'm surprised that your developer never thought about it.
3,Phone,"I want to make sure I'm not charged automatically year after year, and I don't know where to find that. I also don't see the Take A Break ""button"" that has been mentioned...is that only on iPhone? O also don't see where I can customize my plan. I wonder if I have ALL of the options for my $19.99. I appreciate not having the ads, but I think that's basically the only benefit for me."
3,Phone,"Doesn't work as expected. To end fasting needs user act, trying to correct end fast time causes plan to abort and the need to select again. When it works, it's good, but counter intuitive controls spoil it"
3,Phone,Simple app for keeping track of your fasting cycle. However the only notification that works is the water reminder. Start of fast and end of fast reminders don't seem to work at all.
3,Phone,I'm so confused. When you have finished a fasting and it goes into eating time. Does it automatically go back to fasting when it's time or do i have to start the fasting on the app again myself? How do you know how long you have left for the eating time. Iv just done a 20h fast and have just set a reminder for the next fast at 8.30. Would be handy if it just ran one after other when you select your plan.
3,Phone,"Great app. But It will be better if the app allow backup. I just recently upgraded my phone,there is no way for me to transfer data from the old phone to the new one. Tried Samsung smart switch, Huawei Phone Clone but none seem to be working"
3,Phone,"Can't change simple things. Like starting weight. Ive used this before and am starting at a lower weight. Can't find that setting anywhere. Also with the schedules, no one eats till 10 pm, so if I want I want to keep their schedule but start fasting sooner, there is really no way to change it without messing the preset schedule up."
3,Phone,"The app design is beautiful. I subscribed to premium, and I was very disappointed. Besides some other fasting schedules (that anyway you don't need an app for that), basically just add a very few tips and recipes. Always the same. So, what is the subscription for? I expect continously new tips and recipes."
3,Phone,Yeah really good app. If I had one criticism is that is it trying to do too much - lot of information there whereas you might just be looking for a simple timer. I also couldn't see an edit button for those times you might want to change start time.
3,Phone,"I started my tracker a couple hours after I started fasting and I don't see anywhere to edit a fast. Usually on other fasting apps, it's simply a slide of a button. Honestly, I don't like that."
3,Phone,"Very motivating and a fun way to get into intermittent fasting. But definitely too expensive for what it delivers. I whish they'd have a yearly subscription like others do at a steep discount. But having to pay so much every month, I will cancel as soon as I am used to fasting."
3,Phone,"it's good but sometimes when I click the ""stop fasting"" or ""begin fasting"" button, I'll come back to the app to see that it didn't actually record that time, and now I'm stuck trying to guess what time it was, and I end up not having an accurate time for my fast/eating period"
3,Phone,I like that there is a weight tracking tool. But the major downside is that you can't edit when you stopped your fast. So in my case my phone was off and my fast time was off by 5 hours. If you could edit fast ending times this app would recieve 4/5 stars.
3,Phone,"Great app that keeps me focused on my health goals. Thumbs up! Update (17.11.20): Everything was OK so far, but today I start receiving ads in Portuguese, which I don't understand, so I don't know which button to click to exit ad. And it's getting annoying..."
3,Phone,This app is great for reminders to drink etc. My issue is that it drains my battery quite quickly and locks up my phone. There was a noticeable difference in the way my phone performed once I uninstalled.
3,Phone,"Nice app, but found a fail. The program should let me change the time of my fasting during the fasting program without changing the program. I have started the 14/10 program but decided to keep fasting for longer period cause I'm feeling good. I tried to add more time of fasting but the program doesn't allow me to do it."
3,Phone,"It would be better if the fasting cycles started and stopped automatically (based on the time schedule you set) and just notified me, instead of having to manually go in and start/stop it each time, which I always forget to do and then the next day it thinks I've been fasting for 24+hours and the cycle is all thrown off."
3,Phone,Decent app but very difficult to change plans. It should be easy to start with a 14 10 and then realize you can manage 15 9 or 16 8 and make that change easily. Constant error that you are currently fasting. And I paid for the full app. So there's no excuse.
3,Phone,"The app is extremely user friendly but support needs some improvement. I have sent several Emails about issues, some are resolved but the main one, syncing with Google Fit, is still outstanding and have not heard from them. I would give it 5 stars if support improved."
3,Phone,"I liked the different fasting plans and being able to edit your fasting start time, but I didn't like that I couldn't change the end time of my fasting. For that, I'm uninstalling because I want something flexible on all ends for accurate tracking."
3,Phone,"It's a great app. The problem is that options for more than 24hrs are written off as ""Custom"". This doesn't allow a person to keep track of time left to a, say, 36hr fast. I suggest you add an option for adjustable fasts >20hrs"
3,Phone,Would be great but the ads Omg. At first it wasn't that bad but then it got overbearing. I could understand banner ads but just trying to sign in and lock something and with everything I do it's now requiring an ad. After having it for a while I'm finally uninstalling.
3,Phone,"Please add a function to turn off the notification noise of the 'drink water reminder', without putting my phone on silent. It's always way too loud and and the sound it makes is difficult to explain. Honestly my only complaint rn so I'll up ot to a five if this is added. Thank you."
3,Phone,I really like it and it was great the fir two or three weeks. But then it kept changing my fasting/eating times. It was weird and annoying. I would finish a fasting period and an hour or two later it would signal that my fasting period had become. Please fix!
3,Phone,"I really like the app! However I give it 3 stars because i dont like when you try to edit the history of your fast it automatically sets It to the day before. For example I fasted from 830pm yesterday (3/21) to today(3/22) 1230pm. I initially ended the fast but then I decided to wait to eat, pushing my time to 230pm. When I tried to edit the already saved fast, it preset the start and end dates to 3/21, therefore making it look as if I didn't fast the full 18hrs. Fix this and its 5 stars"
3,Phone,"The original problem has been fixed,, but now if i need to go back to 2 days to edit it aborts the fast. There is a glitch. I emailed about this also. If you forget to abort your fast, and go back to adjust the time, it will not let you adjust it for the same day. You have to choose yesterday. Then go back to re-adjust the time to the correct day on the next day. It gets confusing. And very annoying. Seems like it should be a simple fix too. Wish you would just fix it. I did pay for the app."
3,Phone,"The design is great. I love the water reminders, the education aspect is very helpful but the fasting time starts automatically. On the days where I start fasting a little earlier or a tad later I'd like to adjust for that easily without accidentally disrupting my week."
3,Phone,"The app itself is great. The graphic and everything makes it unique and user friendly. However, it's the idea that the app is based on that I have serious issues with. Fasting regularly is not healthy at all. I wanted to get thin so bad that I overlooked this fact and installed the app anyway. It had reverse effect on my eating habit. I got so hungry I could nearly show no self control. You're a good team, please revise your core value (of fasting)"
3,Phone,"For the price of the subscription, And the app shows protein and fat nutrition pictures. I thought we could save the food we eat and have a record and track the protein, fat and all minerals intake. Just the recipes alone few insights and plans extra for a yearly subscription is a waste. I'm from different culture and your recipes are of no use to me. And you ask if what diet but according to that I couldn't see any specific diet it's all random nonveg recipes. Add food tracker for a 5 stars."
3,Phone,"It works as a timer... and that seems to be it. I never get notified before or after a fasting/eating period, even though I've set them to notify me. Sometimes I start or end my fasts late because I don't get the hour reminder. Worked first day, never again. But it tracks like it says, so ?????"
3,Phone,"There IS A BIG BUG when you choose to have alerting notifications : it vibrates and makes each seconds, because the notification refreshes. You HAVE to put it in silent notifications so it won't bother you. Developers have a look at this. Used on Google Pixel 3XL Android 10.x"
3,Phone,When I got a new phone I lost all my data. I backup everything on micro SD & cloud acct... All lost. Months of fasting records vanished. What good is the app if it doesn't keep records? I sent feedback to the developer so maybe they will fix it. I'll update here if they do.
3,Phone,"Frustrating to use - can't read articles although the app shows you plenty of them. It just wants me to sign up and pay for the app....constant messages that are obnoxious. Of course you want me to pay, but I need to use it for a time to see if it works for me before paying for the use of it. Will probably uninstall and go elsewhere"
3,Phone,So far I enjoy the app. It can be synthesized with the Google Fit app and has dark mode but I recently got a new phone and could not find any way of actually creating an account or transferring you history/activity from the old device... please advise/add this feature
3,Phone,"The free app is ok, not too many ads and short. Does a good job reminding you to get water, recording times, weight. But many other apps do the same. Hence, the three stars."
3,Phone,"Just completed my first day of fasting, doing the 16/8. It notified me that I made it, I click on it, it asked me when my last meal was(yesterday at 7pm) and it says it has not been long enough to be considered fasting. It's been 16 hours. -.- But now according to the app I have never completed a fast. Edit: when it's asking you to note last meal, it's under the assumption you already ate to start the eating on the next day wish it was clearer on what it's asking for. Avoid confusion for people"
3,Phone,Been using this app for a few months and just decided pay for the no ads version today. It's good. My only issue is that the data did not pull over from my old phone. Is there a way to set up an acct or transfer data? Please reach out to me as I can see my progress history now. ?? ?? At the moment taking stars off for that.
3,Phone,"A little too detailed and a little too invasive for my comfort. There appears to be no way to control personal data once you have it. I could see some folks liking the heavy coaching, but I do not like it."
3,Phone,It reminds me to hydrate. Keeps track of my fasting time. I like the app. It is doing exactly what I would expect it to do. Only a few plans available though unless you upgrade to premium.
3,Phone,"I'm not getting any notification reminders besides the initial start time one. Then say 62 hours has gone by, I'd have to open the app before it asks ""are you still fasting?"" As in...""have you been fasting a full 62 hours? Go you!"" Like, no, I haven't been fasting for 62 hours straight. Some kind of reminder to ask when the fasting plan you're on has ended just for the day.. would be good to stay on track."
3,Phone,"The app works well but the 3 stars are for having to double tap, past their ads, to get out of the app. Its VERY annoying. I wouldn't recommend this one, and I'm looking for another app for that reason."
3,Phone,"Annoying that I can't delete or change old data as I put in my weight wrong and now it looks like I've lost a bunch of weight in a day just because I corrected it. It's a good, basic app but this is annoying."
3,Phone,"Honestly this is a great tracker and supports you throughout the entire process. But the reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it can also make you feel guilty and more self concious feelings come up when that happens. After my friends realized I was on a type of diet, they asked me why I wanted to do that, bc I should feel comfortable with what I look like. I don't think it means to, but the app makes you think that you're willing to starve yourself bc you want to look more ""pretty"""
3,Phone,"This app should be able to stop and start based on the time you set. You should be able to hear an alarm for start and end times. Instead, it makes you manually do this and then shifts the time if you don't stop the clock. Please fix this on the app."
3,Phone,I really liked the app. But within days of using it you begin to have to go though multiple ad screens that are annoying and you can't close them for a period of time. I'm uninstalling the app.
3,Phone,"I purchased the Premium and used it for 24 days and didn't lose an ounce. What they don't tell you is that if you're post menopausal it can actually be worse for you to intermittent fast than to do regular eating. If you're hormones aren't just right, they can get even more messed up by fasting and that is what appears to be happening to me. I feel worse today than I did when I started a month ago. I'm done."
3,Phone,"Love even a free version. Going to get a subscription. P.s. I regret I wasted money on subscription. No 12/12 fasting, custom was there anyway but it does not have notifications, menu is a just ""Maggie diet"" that isn't healthy, I also did not find an option for 1 day break."
3,Phone,It's ok for a basic app. I've had better free apps. You have to pay to read articles (google it instead - free and probably more info) and there is only a water tracker widget rather than a widget that keeps track of hours. I'm going to keep searching and ditch this one. Response to devs: I want a free app. Health should not only be accessible to those who have money. I found a better app and I can google articles if need be. Thanks.
3,Phone,"It doesn't seem to offer a connection to the Fitbit app to import weight, etc. Otherwise I like the reminders to drink water and the easy interface."
3,Phone,"Hi, pls unsubscribe me from premier . I don't want to have 350 rupees deducted every month . I haven't used this app in a long time I do not want to give any feedback. I want to cancel subscription. Any reason why u did not give that option to cancel subscription. Can mine immediately. This is my second request in a row in 2nd month My 4th request to unsubscribe I have done what u have asked me, even sent an email. Am I unsubscribed yet ?? No response from the team at all but taking money"
3,Phone,"Even though notifications to do so are on, the app doesn't give me indicators if when my fasting period is due to start/stop so i have to mentally track times on my own. It kind of makes the app redundant as a result."
3,Phone,"I would have rated this a 5 Stars based on how informative and motivating this tracker is for fasting! But being that I pay for the premium option, and I'm getting bombarded with ads... that's not okay! Shouldn't paying into your app bypass the ads?!"
3,Phone,"Unless you join the Premium version, this app offers little more than a timer and history of your fasts. When you try to see one of the hints pages, you are transported to a premium sign-up page. Without knowing more about what hints are available, not biting. Figure The Complete Book of Fasting by Dr.. Jason Fong offers more information for about the cost of a yearly membership to this ap."
3,Phone,"Good but needs more options for trial users. Also, when I first started using this (I'm 10 days in), I was able to edit how much water I drank on previous days and now I can't. For the life of me can't figure out why, and usually I'll forget to count all the water I drank that day, so it's necessary for me to go back and correct it the next day. Please fix this and I will pay and give 5 stars!!!"
3,Phone,"So far, tracking of the fasting is working well. However, I would have liked to have been able to track food as well and have had to download another app for this purpose. Would be must better to have it all in one place. I do have the premium paid version."
3,Phone,I installed this app just today.. It looks & sounds good.. I want to join the fasting program... I selected to pay one month premium of Rs. 350/- which is already debited from my bank account through GPay.. But my premium subscription is not reflecting on the app.. The app is still asking me to buy the premium pack.. Why so..? What about my paid money..? Kindly resolve..
3,Phone,"Wish there were more ""free articles"" to help out. I want to see more content to see what they have to truly offer those of us who are a step above beginners not quite well versed.... Really see if those tid bits are worth the subscription cost!"
3,Phone,Very supportive and informative but I wish it was easier to set your own fasting schedule. Other apps are a bit easier in this respect and perhaps this could be improved so you can add other times/days
3,Phone,"Oh, I downloaded because I thought it will help me to take proper diet after fasting however, this app is not for Muslims as it says; one can drink water,tea or coffee when feel thirsty and it says one can listen to music to distract themselve from fasting. Hence, I won't recommend this app to a Muslim no offence. I gave it a 3 star because I'm neutral."
3,Phone,"Hi. I've just downloaded this app and need to improvise. I hope it works, but is it possible that you could make it more flexible? I work night shifts and eat at 1am when working (which is weekends). I eat at around 9pm when I'm not (which is 3 weekdays per week). I also do not eat breakfast or lunch. My improvisation comes from my eating period of when I am working, and when I'm not. Thoughts?"
3,Phone,I just want to say that the app is great but you're encouraging people to continue their fast even for 3 days which can be really harmful for the body. 18 hrs fasting and user will only reach level 6 out of 11 levels. People will try to achieve higher levels so they will literally starve themselves. Please lower your levels or put a lock above 18 hrs in free app mode. Thanks
3,Phone,Loved this app until the ads open with sound every time even with my phone on silent. Not good if you don't want an ad blaring & disturbing everyone around you. Didn't mind the silent ads but getting rid of it b/c of the sound on ones.
3,Phone,The full screen ads are terrible. Displaying ads isn't the problem. Displaying ads that take the whole screen and prevents you from using the app for its tended purpose is.
3,Phone,"It was great at first and helped me lose a little weight but then it started making me gain weight even when I wasn't eating much. I wanted to lose weight, not gain weight. And I've been keeping myself hydrated throughout the day while fasting but I got real bad sick the other day so I stopped using it. Such a shame too cuz it really is a good app and it was helping me but it doesn't anymore. Not doing this out of spite, just being honest and to warn others about the dangers of it"
3,Phone,"Seems like a decent app, but I uninstalled due to very interrupting video advertisements which pop up quite frequently. There are other equally good app options out there which don't have video ads!"
3,Phone,"I have special dietary needs. There is no where for me to indicate that or get recipes based on my them. Also I only eat one meal a day. I can't indicate that either so it thinks I have breakfast at 1800, lunch at noon, and dinner at 1700. garbage. Its got a cute counter and hasn't crashed. Thats the best I can say. Not worth it."
3,Phone,"The ads are not too intrusive, but 8 am recording when I start or stop, only to find out it did not save. Happened quite a few times don't know if I am doing something wrong or the app has errors"
3,Phone,"There is no exercise plan, t no diet plan! You have to resort to other apps! Not even tracking your water! Ony tracks fasting and feeding times! Only give advice about drinking the water and exercise, If you do exercise keep it light on your fasting will the only advice."
3,Phone,"Great free app. V useful, however there are a shocking level of intrusive adverts that switch on and play sound even with volumme on phone switched off. . Not so discrete when at work etc. Will continue using for now and see how annoying they get."
3,Phone,"I have no idea how to use this app. I found the app in the morning,before breakfast time. I sign up and as a begginer i chose the easiest plan. They calculated it and it says fasting till 11pm.. Really? Its only 9:30am. So when am i supposed to eat? At night,while i am sleeping? I would like it to be the other way round. I thought it was made for beginners as well. Is there anything i did wrong?"
3,Phone,"The bottons to edit the fasting time are really annoying, have it fixed and I will change my rating"
3,Phone,I really enjoy the app and I even payed for all the extra tips and things. It's perfect for telling you where you're at in the process but I can't give 5 stars because it's completely geared toward woman. If gives you option for male and female but all the tips are woman oriented and it left me a little disappointed.
3,Phone,Great! Exept for the notifications...If I have notifications on Vibrate it continues to buzz indefinitely until I turn it on silent or soft reset the phone. Which means I don't have easy access to the tracker while fasting.
3,Phone,"I was charged $27 and the app showed 14.99. I contacted customer service and it took 3 weeks for them to reply for my request. The app is good and very useful, just the menu needs improvement since it only has few options even when you pay premium."
3,Phone,"I paid for the year and so far not seeing the perks of the paid version over the free. I also wish the multi week plans would just automatically continue. Unless I'm doing it wrong, I start the plan and on Friday it's completed. Then I manually have to go and select the next week."
3,Phone,"It would be really cool if all plans were free, or maybe at least 10in2 and autophagy but except that it's a great app for beginners because as I said not everything is free so you have to pay for more advanced plans"
3,Phone,"Wanted to 5 star this app, every reminder feature and information display is logical & helpful. However, the inability to continue a fast for a few hours when desired is frustrating. Maybe I'm missing something?"
3,Phone,"Nothing special. Free version is pretty basic, ads are a little obnoxious for an app with a premium option. Couldn't sync data to new phone, so I'll try out similar apps instead."
3,Phone,I'm confused. The photos displayed on the app to encourage you to install are not the photos on my app plus apart from the timer part what else is there? Am I missing something on the app. I paid for 6 months but surely it can't just be a timer. Can anyone advice?
3,Phone,"It's good, but I have to reset it everyday. It won't do the same hours for each day. I ended up accidentally deleting all my previous fasting record trying to find how to do it. Frustrating.."
3,Phone,Honestly I'm only on my 2nd day. I don't know why apps always ask you to rate them before you have a single clue. How much you like it or don't like it. But so far I like it.
3,Phone,I have the basic version and much of it works well. I enables me to track when I'm eating and when I'm fasting. I will fast longer than my usual 16 hours ( which is not offered by this app) but I don't believe frequent longer fasting is positive for most people. Every day it feels as though I have failed if I break my fast and eat. Prior to using this app I successfully lost 45 pounds over 18 months by fasting 16 hours per day. Now I'm feeling guilty for eating. Not healthy
3,Phone,"Why is it always running in the background? Push notifications would be sufficient for this app, but it is always running in the background with an icon in my task/notification bar. Im well aware that I should be eating at 1pm and fasting by 9pm..??"
3,Phone,Good but notifications aren't working. The bar at the top of notifications is cool but doesn't update or let you know when to stop/start fasting when other apps do this.
3,Phone,"I have just started using this app. I really like the way it is set out, but why does it keep changing my settings back to kg and fl oz. Every time I go into it I am changing to lbs and ml...it is driving me mad and may well end up with me deleting altogether!"
3,Phone,I like it. It does what it says. The ads are annoying. And the widget for hydration doesn't stay in the unit I change it to. I'm probably going to try another app.
3,Phone,The problem I have with this app is they don't create a plan for you at all as indicated. They ask how much you want to lose and at what level you want to fast/lose weight. Then they tell you they've created a plan for what you chose and to subscribe to see it. After paying you'll discover they didn't create any plan for you at all and you're on your own to choose which fasting plan you want- nothing tailored to you at all! Disappointing!
3,Phone,I subscribed to premium but it doesn't reflect on the app. I still see ads and can't access other features. Its sad because I have been using this for months already and what happened when I subscribed to premium? Kindly fix it.
3,Phone,"Too many annoying ads. Ok, we get it with the premium version, but you make your own app unusable without the premium version in this way. They're tons of other apps on the market."
3,Phone,"Good app, however it is highly geared towards women. Most all images are of women most all recommendations And guides are for women. Such as "" As a woman how to _____"" Definitely just kind of leaves men out. No real suggestions on how to handle intermittent fasting if you are a burly man or a skinny man... Not even to mention that it is incredibly important for weight loss and overall health for men to watch Muscle fatigue, muscle consumption, And the best ways to keep bulk and strength..."
3,Phone,"I gave 3 stars since I am confused about the time of fasting reflected in my record. I started fasting 5 days ago and I always complete my 12 hours of fasting but my record says that I just did fasting for 9 hours, 12 hours etc. I know I completed the 14 hours daily since the app notifies me whenever the time alloted for my fasting is done. Please enlighten me about this. It's not helping in motivating me. Thank you"
3,Phone,"From what I can see, the app is just a timer...with lots and lots of ads to get you to upgrade to their premium. No info provided without upgrade. I could do a timer on my phone's clock."
3,Phone,"Each time the app is opened, an ad appears, and most times you will be forced to listen before closing the ad. This very annoying. The tracking is fine, but I am removing the app."
3,Phone,"So far, so good, no issues. Do wish there were more fasting hour options"
3,Phone,Going with result oriented approach and will come back to rate 5 stars once I get the results.
3,Phone,I like it I really do only problem is I can't afford premium recipes ??
3,Phone,"Don't know what is happening but whenever i start the timer in night , And check in morning there is no timer started"
3,Phone,"The app overall is very nice, easy to use and flexible. However the water reminder cannot be switched off, it's really annoying!"
3,Phone,"While this app has some interesting information and features, it requires a paid subscription for more than basic function. It eats battery like crazy, and is not easy to use."
3,Phone,"Decent app, does the basics, but the ""recent fasts"" shows weird numbers. I fasted 12h, 16h, 16h, 24h and it shows 13.7h, 19.6h, 17.7h, 22h. It be nice if there was a website option to pair with the app."
3,Phone,"Not Automated. I would love for an alarm when fasting is about to begin, you can then accept to start at the scheduled time, or delay. Otherwise, it's good and easy to use."
3,Phone,Its basic but hard to use. I try setting it manually and it doesn't do what I input!! I upgraded & paid for 6 months and nothing changed from the basic free one?? I'm So confused and irritated!!!! I spent money on this app...for what???
3,Phone,"Very useful app, I just love it! Been doing my 72hrs fasting and I have lost quiet a significant amount of weight, very easy to use, I just dont like the adverts!"
3,Phone,"Too many Bugs. This app never works correctly. Keep saying I'm fasting 24 hrs after I've ended fasting period. I have to constantly manually changes my start and ending period. I was hoping the paid app would work properly, foolish me for buying this app. What is the refund policy?"
3,Phone,"I would have given this 4 stars, but the ads are so annoying, I have to close my app once to get past the Facebook ad and then open it again to get past it. I will uninstall if this continues."
3,Phone,"Great to use,it does not give alot of plans because some are on premium and you can only do beginners fasting and advanced , if you want intermediate you have to pay,I love the tips and triks that they give for fasting"
3,Phone,"Not bad. My only beef so far is the app is for whatever reason bad at telling time. For example if my fast started at 8pm and ends at 12pm the following day, it should be 16hr0min. However half of the time my fast will be 15hr59m. Not that it's a huge deal, but it throws my fast off by 1 minute later if I set it to 16hours manually when ending the fast. So I have to go back and edit the start time, but still 16 hours on the dot registers as 15:59. So I need to go edit the start time to 7:59."
3,Phone,"I find it difficult to set my preferences. I can't change when i start or end a fast with the custom setting. It's a bit fiddly. I am better off with a watch, really."
3,Phone,I really liked the app but did not enjoy or appreciate being bombarded with soft porn ads of half naked women. If this was supposed to inspire me to purchase the ad free version it failed...I simply uninstalled your app!
3,Phone,With the update an add pops up as soon as you open it. You have to wait for the option to skip. I didn't mind the adds before but this is too annoying to keep using the app
3,Phone,Would have given it a five stars but the ads are too much
3,Phone,"The app is great and easy to use, but there are too many ads.. I find these ads too annoying, especially the videos, so for that reason, I decided to uninstall it."
3,Phone,"Good app, but the widget is broken. When I start a fast and forget to activate the widget beforehand, it will show the wrong elapsed time. It should show an elapsed time based on what you input as your starting point, not when you activate the widget. My current fast has been ongoing for 15 hours, not 5 minutes."
3,Phone,"Very busy UI, lots going on with not a lot of substance. Pop up adverts are of junk food, not great considering it's a diet app. Other than that, does what it's meant to."
3,Phone,The insights use to be free and extremely helpful...I really liked that. Without the insights it really is...as one person stated...a glorified timer.
3,Phone,"Great app, so informative, tells you what fasting status you are at, however, this is draining my battery quicker than other apps. For the devs, if you can change it so it doesn't run constantly and drain battery I will be willing to download again. Thanks."
3,Phone,"Not bad for single day fasting, but it refuses to keep me on the weekly plans. It's like it just deletes that moment I was like ""yeah, I do want to fast for 16hrs a day off the foreseeable future."" It looks nice and is educational though."
3,Phone,"I just paid for the premium subscription..however once I did, I wasn't truly satisfied, don't believe it's worth the money. I can't figure out how to cancel the subscription. I've looked everywhere in the app and there is no way to end subscription from the app. Can someone please explain this and how I can?"
3,Phone,Very good for keeping on track and easy to use. Would be nice if there was trial for the premium or I little bit more free modes or content. 3/5 is fair with that many ads lol
3,Phone,"A bit confuse with the plan, for beginning should have suggestion. And, I understand free apps have ads, but it TOO MUCH ads. Everything I click, the ads come out. It so ignored."
3,Phone,"Loved this app, I've been using it for 3 months but now it won't update its dates and times so I have been unable to accurately record and track my fasting time and eating periods. It still has the date from 2 days ago and nothing further."
3,Phone,"I've used this app for a while. But now when I use it the Ads are very annoying. They pop up every 10 seconds. I use to like the app before. It had more features, but now it's just annoying."
3,Phone,It's an okay app. I like how friendly it is. It's very easy to work. I just wish it had a notification (with sound) that tells me my fasting is ending and when it starts.
3,Phone,"It's helpful for keeping track of hours & water intake, but the diet suggestions (at least for me) were unsustainable and unrealistic, as I could not tailor it to my food allergy & blood sugar restrictions."
3,Phone,Great app except you have to manually reset your plan every week and it's really annoying also there are a bunch of ads. There are othere apps that don't have these down sides.
3,Phone,Is an ok app. I've been using this alongside another fasting app. There are too many ads. The app is too basic to entice me to want to pay $2.99 to get rid of the ads.
3,Phone,3 star only because theres no edit to adjust the time. I used to have The other fasting app and I can edit and move the time. This app no you can't! I purchase 1 month subscription and that's it I'm out!
3,Phone,"The app itself works fine, more than fine actually. My only issue is with the ads, more specifically, the amount of them. There's way to many ads."
3,Phone,"Good app, but too many ads and only half the options are free. It's handy and very informative and educational, but also a bit annoying with the money grubbing."
3,Phone,"1st day seems overall easy use. Pet pev on this app is the fact it only rates your weight success based on BMI which is a completely inaccurate form of weight measurement expecially for high muscle mass individuals like me. BMI hasnt been accurate for me since long before highschool when i 1st started working out. It would be nice to at least be able to disable the BMI from being seen. Or if possible have a more accurate way to track my fat level like body fat percentage, even manual% entry."
3,Phone,"Moderately good. Unless I missed it, there's no option to correct entry for fasting and feeding times. No way to correct a whoops entry."
3,Phone,"It's good, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a fasting timer that runs automatically. It seems you have to manually start/stop the timer."
3,Phone,I like the app but it asks me to choose a fasting plan and enter my times every day. It's really annoying that it isn't remembering the fasting and times that I've chosen.
3,Phone,"I'm not sure how this works. Also the hydrate, fast and eat notifications disappear after dinner time and only comes back when I open the app."
3,Phone,Cool app but I'm not sure if fasting actually helps. I'm recording my natural fasting patterns which seem to be around 13-16h w/o food per day over this first week. That's higher than recomended I think but that's just how my body works But my weight continues to maintain or fluctuate 2-3 pounds up or down. I never actually lose weight so I don't think fasting actually works. I'm reading everywhere that your body actually holds onto fat if you don't eat so isn't this abit counter productive?
3,Phone,Way too many ads!! Every time you open the app ads start popping up. Have to go to your restart back button to get the app to open and even then ads keep popping up. Frustrating app.
3,Phone,"I like the app but I thought once you set a fasting time it would automatically do it everyday. When I logged on this morning it asked if I wanted to start another fast. So instead of saying I'm in a fast right now, it's telling me when my next one starts."
3,Phone,"It's a great app, except that it has some false misleading information. It claims that your body will only start to break down amino acids and convert them into energy after 3 days of fasting where in fact that starts happening after the 24h mark, so if you fast for longer than 24h just know that the weight you're going to lose from there is from your muscle mass, not fat. Also, the water reminder is annoying, I personally can drink up to 1L at one sit, I don't need a reminder every hour"
3,Phone,This app starts off fantastic and free for weeks and sets one off on a good path but then sadly stutters and stops being effective automatically. Perhaps to encourage a pay plan. I just add the hours to my last evening meal if my last bite is 8pm and I am 16/8 8pm to 8am is 12 hours plus 4 more hours is noon. I put that in my phone timer and have ZERO food until that timer goes off. My eating window begins at the timer with a banana. Nice not to think about food.
3,Phone,Great app. I love the details on hourly zones. I understand the ads are required but they seem a little excessive. Just my opinion.
3,Phone,"I like how the app lets me know what phase I am in, and love the reminders. Biggest downside is, I am not one who carries their phone everywhere. Would be a 5 star app, if i could connect the reminders to my Samsung watch."
3,Phone,"What is premium? What new things are offered on a monthly basis that justifies a monthly charge? I dont understand the business model, its a glorified timer, how is it not just 1 payment and you own it. Why is it a monthly subscription??"
3,Phone,I've been intermittent fasting for 7 days straight. Yet it says I've completed one day. It doesn't seem to track. Only counts down to your next deadline.
3,Phone,"Really good app, only letdown is I can't find a way to start the app automatically after a phone reboot so have to manually open the app to get reminders."
3,Phone,Not sure how i feel about it. I dont like how it resets after every fast and I have to constantly pick a plan. It throws me off.
3,Phone,"The Covid snippet in the ""immune cells regenerate"" section is absolutely ridiculous and out of place. You really should consider removing that. Otherwise, the app is decent to track a fast."
3,Phone,Great except for the ads
3,Phone,"I installed this app, and I found.it really hard to navigate and I couldn't understand the custom thing. I put it in to start fasting at 12pm and it was saying I had already fasted for 9 hours, which makes no sense because I just downloaded this app-"
3,Phone,"This app added water tracker and it's very useful. It would be great if there is edit function as in ""Water Drink Reminder"" app. I need to update my water tracker for yesterday."
3,Phone,Seems OK but I tried to start a new plan and it said I'm currently fasting and to end it however my app says I'm in my eating window. There was another bug where the date was wrong when trying to manually change the dates
3,Phone,This app is hard to navigate. It doesn't explain how to start times or end early or extend fasted time. Not much advise or help to find on app. I might look for a different one.
3,Phone,The premium version is supposed to come with recipes but there are none. I have clicked everywhere. Really expensive app for that you get. My wife had a free app with the same features. Blah.
3,Phone,"Seems helpful enough, but I'm going to set a daily alarm and not eat after the alarm goes off instead. Thanks for the idea."
3,Phone,I have paid a yearly subscribtion but it billing me every month for 17.9 p. ?? I have sent the evident to the feedback and got an answer that it might be monthly payment ... I again sent the evident that it was written 'yearly' by email. Please answer me.
3,Phone,"It is what it is, a tracker, so you pretty much have to reset it after each fast but it help you track your fasting and feeding period"
3,Phone,Love the fasting stages. BUT this app isn't very user friendly. I am doing 36 hour fasts 3x per week. But it won't allow me to add a fasting time from now (8pm) till midnight because I already fasted from midnight last night to 6 am. Bit annoying and I wish I hadn't paid for it because there are better apps out there.
3,Phone,"App seems decent, but I do not support the subscription based service model for software. Sorry, but I have too many services now that want me to make regular payments in perpetuity."
3,Phone,The app itself is great but... I paid for 6 months of premium hoping it would bring me more features but it didn't. I am also still getting ads come through... So what has my 10 pound paid for exactly?
3,Phone,I dislike that it only tracks water. Other apps will allow you to enter beverages and adjust intake accordingly. Meal plans are ridiculous. Like half grapefruit and boiled eggs.
3,Phone,"I've been using for about a week now and like the simplicity but I'm confused about the hours it's showing. I've been doing 8:16 and haven't cut more than 1 fast short (and even that only by a few minutes) but I've got days that show I fasted for under 16 hours. Am I doing something wrong, or is the app?"
3,Phone,There is something wrong with the app. I can no longer choose Today to end my fast. I can choose yesterday and the days before but not today. It's been happening for about 4 days. Super disappointed.
3,Phone,Just downloaded the app on my android and on my wife's iPhone. Why is it different for the iPhone? It says after 7 days it will cost $39 per year? Wth? It didn't give me this obstacle on my android. I just emailed the developer so hopefully there's a work around and then I can update the rating.
3,Phone,It keeps me disciplined and helps me prolong my fasting.. however.. Creepy add to get paid for vaccinating keeps popping up... Also.. monthly/annual payments to get full access put a bad taste in my mouth... Will be trying another app
3,Phone,"Premium monthly subscription to read articles about weight, some plans need premium, some gadgets etc, Its kinda hard to learn how to fast and what you can and cant eat when they want 4 dollars to tell you some stuff you can google. Like ""dont drink milk"""
3,Phone,This would be great if it wasn't so glitchy. Doesn't register when I stop or start fasting and there's no way to program that effectively afterwards. Uninstalled.
3,Phone,"App is good for tracking IF progress, the ads have been slowly increasing. Getting close to deleting and switching to another app."
3,Phone,"If I was to rate the app for how well it is made I'd give it 5 stars, but my dear god. Ads upon ads upon ads and then some. Every 5th click on the app is an ad for the love of god."
3,Phone,"It's good for beginners. I was looking for something like advanced because I do 24 hour fasting. I hope there's also 24, 28, 32, 36 hours and so on because I want to challenge myself to fast longer"
3,Phone,"Main reading should show days as well as hours and minutes, not just hours, if im in my 14th day fast and it shows only hours...why would i want to waste my time trying to convert into days? Id like to see it on the screen, Days large font, and next to it small font of hours and seconds"
3,Phone,"When I edit my fasting from the current day, it sets it to yesterday with no option to put it back to today. Other than that I really liked the app til I got this bug."
3,Phone,"I bought premium, made no difference....I click on my premium and only tells me difference between premium and non. I still have the same fasting patterns....I'll rate 5 star once I see the actual benefits of premium"
3,Phone,"Does it not let you choose what type of diet you have? I paid for a year plan, I'm vegan, and everything I see has meat or dairy in it. So the ""meal"" option doesn't really do me any good. I'm a bit disappointed."
3,Phone,I set it for 18-6 with my own hours but once the fast is over it just keeps going with the fasting time. Would have been great if it worked right.
3,Phone,"I should be able to set the ""end time"" of my fast during custom fasting. I can see other users have also recommended that, please add that feature."
3,Phone,"I'm not getting reminders for my fast. I have it set up, and I am getting water reminders. Would be a great app if I could get reminders."
3,Phone,I was enjoying the app until it became very obvious that I was being hijacked by ads like they're going out of fashion! I am unsubscribing as it is just getting too much now.
3,Phone,I liked this app but uninstalled it. Why? Cos the rolling drop down selection just takes too much time to select as it keeps rolling instead of stopping. Should just give option to key in the info instead.
3,Phone,"One of the best fasting apps I've ever tried, but also too much ads whenever i press anywhere an ad got to pop up which is very annoying, I hope they improve this"
3,Phone,"I just downloaded the app this week, but started my intermittent fasting last week. I have no idea how to enter my last week fastinf time. Help please. Thank you."
3,Phone,"App is great. However, I've been using this app for 4 months now, but all my tracked data suddenly disappeared yesterday for no reason at all."
3,Phone,"The app itself is ok, but it has forced ads.... Ugh. I like that it connects to Google health, but having to watch ads is not worth it to me. Uninstalled."
3,Phone,I bought a new phone and none of my fasting data transferred. There is no link to contact. You can send suggestions but no way to ask a question.
3,Phone,"Liking the app but i can not seem to find a place to modify my payment, cancel my subscription, or get contact info. This is concerning to me."
3,Phone,Doesn't save edits to fasting end time. Can't work with that. Not everyone watches their phone every second of the day. Rest seems okay.
3,Phone,I really like this app except I paid for a 6 month plan and all that does is remove the ads?! Is there something I'm missing? What are the benefits of paying a subscription?
3,Phone,Decent app. I dont like that under recent fasting the fasting times are incorrect... even if I've done a 20 hour fast it only shows 13 ect.
3,Phone,I have a problem that i can't change the end time of fasting once I start a plan. The only reason I keep this app is the fasting level.
3,Phone,No fasting widget BUT developer seems to care about improving the app and the layout is very aesthetically pleasing overall.
3,Phone,"I liked it, but there are now a whole lot more ads, had to stop using it. Edit: I get it, but maybe the ads can beat bar at the bottom?"
3,Phone,My wife is not paying for the premium service and has a water tracker plus widget and I am paying for premium service and I do not have this feature. Not sure why?
3,Phone,"I used to love this app, and I still do, but the long unskippable ad every time I open the app is too annoying."
3,Phone,"I completed a 16 hour fast today, but it didn't register....Please fix this! It was the longest fast I ever completed, yet it didn't ""count"" so frustrating -_-"
3,Phone,"Just starting this, I have always been thin sometimes too thin. After years of trying to regulate my weight I did it and have been on the high side of a normal BMI for almost 8 yrs. Ate whatever I wanted. THEN quarantine ( lock down hit) sat in house ate and ate and ate an incredible amount of food. After 10 months I have gained 7 lbs by doing this and now am in overweight category. I do not exercise naturally energetic but that has been limited. So I want to lose what I have gained plus some"
3,Phone,I was loving this app on my old phone. Now on android 11 and can no longer see the weekly fasting schedule which was really helpful. The app seems to be hiding from me when my fasting begins and ends?
3,Phone,"No way to edit the weekly fasting plan so that: 1) a day has 24h fasting, 2) a day has more than 2 intervals. The default plans do have those kinds of timings."
3,Phone,Was great until the bombarded of advertising. A few here and there but too much is a call for me to delete and go to another. Was nice while it lasted.
3,Phone,It shows different achieved fasting times for a single day in different reportings. I've sent 2 emails already to ask about it and never got a reply.
3,Phone,The app is great the reason for 3 stars is that I loss my data one week into fasting...I have to start over die to phone crashing.
3,Phone,"It's alright ig. The ads are kinda mean though, I hit the start fasting button and it showed a Door Dash ad."
3,Phone,"Could be really good, but it is non stop ads. There are much better choices available. Sorry, uninstalling."
3,Phone,"I've selected ml instead of fl oz to track my water intake, and lbs instead of kg to track my weight. For some reason, it keeps switching me back multiple times a day. ?? Please help!"
3,Phone,"Can change the time like clock... Eat time simple meal suggestions pls. Cuz I feel pay for nothing and my friends say just using alarm phone better then this app..and  for refund.  System info(App v1.0.6A5, Model ELE-L29, OS v10, Screen 1080x2139, en _ , GMT+08:00) Also... Please do some to your notification."
3,Phone,"Lagged my phone a lot. Random ads were kinda annoying too. If you have a subscription service, then why do you need ads on top of that?"
3,Phone,"The app is reliable and fairly easy to use, but the amount and disruptiveness of ads is just a tad bit much."
3,Phone,"It's actually a good fasting app, but I find the notifications and badges annoying. I wanted something more simple, and this app wasn't for me."
3,Phone,"I liked it at first but when I was starting to adjust my eating time so that I could be flexible with it, it wouldn't adjust the way I want it to."
3,Phone,"Not sure. I paid the subscription, but I haven't lost any weight. I've had better free apps and I can't figure out how to get a refund."
3,Phone,Not everyone take 3meals per day. The application gives fixed number of meals. I think it would be best if you could set the numver of meals you take
3,Phone,I like your app so far but there is a small problem with it. Those that follow a ketogenic lifestyle remain in a ketosis state. We don't have glycogen stores to burn through after each meal because we eat very little carbs so when we begin fasting after our last meal our body does not have to burn through glycogen stored up to begin fat burning. Our body burns up the food we've eaten then goes right back into fat burning. The timeliness you give don't reflect that. Keto adjustment options?
3,Phone,"i started using this app 2 days ago and its kinda good, but now the app getting slow, i already tried to uninstall and install it again but nothing changed, its still slow, can you fix it? its a good app tbh"
3,Phone,"Nice graphs, but the more relevant functions besides a dumb timer are all hiden behind subscriptions. No, than you."
3,Phone,Difficult to set start/stopped times after a few hours. Forget to update & struggle with settings.
3,Phone,i have joined this app and have set up the timers to notify me the start and finish of fasting but i get no notification also can this be connected to fitbit .
3,Phone,Hi this is a good app but it automaticly took 20.99 from my account last week .i understand how to stop this happening next year but i have NOT recieved the premium yet .i would like a refund of my 20.99 please ..
3,Phone,"Its almost perfect, besides from it lacks of alarm, like for example, if user has done her fasting he/she should have received a notification that her fasting is done. right?"
3,Phone,"I paid for the full year, but last week when in the app it says I don't have the premium anymore. I liked the app which is why I paid for the full year. Please help"
3,Phone,"Good app, but too many ads. Also what's the point having continuous Zomato and swiggy (food delivery ads for People outside india) ads in a fasting app ??"
3,Phone,Is it a good app meh It's a timer that cost money for tips why do that when you could just use paper to write start and finish times And Google tips on what to eat and not eat when fasting
3,Phone,New notification design is questionable at best. I enjoyed the old colourful display in the notifications.
3,Phone,"I no longer use the app hence would like to cancel my subscription. I can not find where exactly to cancel, please help."
3,Phone,Works great until I forget to log my fasting end time . . App won't allow you to enter an earlier time if for example you forgot to end fasting until an hour after breakfast
3,Phone,The app was great but now you can't change the time as easily on a daily basis if your window varies.
3,Phone,I like it as it is informative but as a tracking app it is very basic. Like a timer really.
3,Phone,A nice clean app... However the programs do not allow you to track your actual fast start and finish...
3,Phone,The app itself is fine... But there are waaaaaaay too many advertisements for stupid apps and video games that you have to sit through... I mean waaaaaaay to many.
3,Phone,"Some Ads are fine. Too many ads is terrible. This has too many ads AND in app reminders to pay. The app, minus the ads, is 5 star."
3,Phone,Way too much stuff blocked by a paywall. Not exactly useful if it's so narrowed down to basically a demo.
3,Phone,Too many Ads! This app was perfect until I clicked the update. How do you get rid of the Ads. Is there a restore?
3,Phone,"Overall, it's a good app but quite scummy to have a 2 week timer set before you get bombarded with ads."
3,Phone,This app is good but it needs the ability to pull in weight tracking from other sources like the WiFi/Bluetooth scales or Google Fit or MyFitnessPal...
3,Phone,"nice app, wanted to purchase premium on sale but i get an error that Google play is not up to date (even though it is and i purchased another subscription an hour ago)"
3,Phone,Unable to update fasting end to reflect *today*). Have had no issues prior. I hear it has been updated. How do I update my version?
3,Phone,"There's about 40+ types of fasting plans, but I can't see them. I'm looking for daily plans, but it's very limited. Please help."
3,Phone,"Reinstalled to clear data? First install app had comprehensive information about fasting/ketosis effect on body hour by hour but it's disappeared now? Also NO body status screen there,its shown on installation info but missing from app?"
3,Phone,"I like it, just wish I could change the notification so it's counting down how much I have left vs how long I've been fasting."
3,Phone,Too many ads. App is okay but sending that many ads is not okay for what the app brings to me. Not impressed.
3,Phone,"I only wish if We can change the ending time of the fasting period, because sometimes I forget to stop the app before eating."
3,Phone,Ok seems good so far. When I end or start my fast early or late it's very difficult to adjust and leave future schedule back on track.
3,Phone,"Its ok, but I have to keep correcting the start and stop fasting times, wish it would just keep my settings until I changed them."
3,Phone,The app does not have background process. It shuts down after cleaning some memory or restarting device.
3,Phone,My only complaint is the app takes time to load upon launching it. Plus I wish it would alarm once you complete your daily goal
3,Phone,Nice overall easy to use..just a little hard when you're not subscribed to their subscription.
3,Phone,Won't use so middle road I won't use because using a gimped app because I don't have the subscription f that you really need to have a trial period don't care how cheap it is trial period required
3,Phone,I quite liked the app but found it quite expensive. Can you tell me how to cancel my subscription as I can't see where to cancel the app? Thx
3,Phone,"Nice UI, but doesn't show remaining time, percentage ..., graph with recent fasting splits a fasting to multiple day's"
3,Phone,"Useful app, but since month change I can't edit my end fast time to earlier today. The first option is yesterday or dates in March"
3,Phone,I believe the articles shoulnt be locked behond a payway and could be unlocked if the user achieved enough goals in this app. Otherwise its only a 3 star for me.
3,Phone,I like fasting because it is easier. Like cutting drinking to certain times a day but don't know if fasting led to me getting sick.
3,Phone,#NAME?
3,Phone,"Pretty good, but sometimes I get stressed out with the fasting for some reason :( other than that, you guys are awesome !!"
3,Phone,"Don't see why u need to pay for an app to tell u how to fast n what to eat when it's common sense anyways,I'll use without paying n see how I get on may add more ?'s if its better than I think,mayb I should of read reviews lol, seems to be many negative 2?'s n under, never mind, only thing it was gud for was the timmer for how long I fast n how long I was allowed to eat,i said if I find it any better I'll add ?'s, so to my word I will add 1 for what I just said about timmer, upto 3 ?'s, lol"
3,Phone,"It will be nice that if we start to share your app, you will avoid to charge us the money to become premium. That's it. Thanks"
3,Phone,I did not even use this app. I did not realize there was a charge to check it out/test this app. Please reimburse me the fee asap. Thank you!
3,Phone,"I paid for premium, don't see a big difference, it keeps switching to some weird mods I didn't enter."
3,Phone,Seems like the free version is just a timer and not much more. Too many ads.
3,Phone,"Its okay but it needs more information on the other methods of fasting like alternate day fasting, it mostly focuses on intermittent fasting"
3,Phone,So far I really like the app. Unfortunately I keep getting an error message when trying to connect to Google Fit.
3,Phone,So far so good. Patiently waiting to track my results after a month
3,Phone,The obnoxious ads when you first open the app are enough to make me want to uninstall. I used to really like this app.
3,Phone,I thought this app will give you notifs about fasting and rehydration time but its not. You need to update it manually everytime!
3,Phone,Has no option to export import data. I don't want to sign up for this just to have my data persistent.
3,Phone,"I like this app, with its timer and goal weight chart. However I wish there was a way to ask questions or join a community."
3,Phone,"I don't mind ads, but the auto play videos that you can't stop for the first few secs are a bit naughty"
3,Phone,"Pity when you're a member you cannot start your plans whenever you want, apart from on time. I never had received adds probably connected to your social media sites and as I've never been on them"
3,Phone,"Ok, but I would like to be able to change the preset amounts of water, and if I have to change something from the previous day, I would like to be able to do it."
3,Phone,"I just install and buy the premium, i wonder what the diiferent . My premium dont give me any advantage. I hope to get tips daily or weekly like other fastic aplication"
3,Phone,"used it a few days. Good fasting features, google fit sync but subscription too high"
3,Phone,"I love the app, But is there a way to back up data to restore later when I change my phone? Or is that in premium package?"
3,Phone,"This used to be an awesome app, now the ads are more hindering and making it almost not worth using anymore."
3,Phone,"Solid app, but.... It's great overall but I deleted the app then couldn't load my profile back once I reinstalled it."
3,Phone,"Not user friendly, confusing and limited options for recording data."
3,Phone,"Was a good app, now just loaded with ads"
3,Phone,I used to love it but now the adds are so predatory it's really brought the experience down. I would give 5/5 a few patches ago now only 3/5
